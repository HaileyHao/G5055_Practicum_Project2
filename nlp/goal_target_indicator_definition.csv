economic resources, as well as access to …, ownership of and control over land and other forms of 
Last reviewed: August 2021 
property, inheritance, natural resources). It measures the results of policies that aim to strengthen tenure 
security for all, including women and other vulnerable groups. 
 
Indicator 1.4.2 covers (a) all types of land use (such as residential, commercial, agricultural, forestry, grazing, 
wetlands based on standard land-use classification) in both rural and urban areas; and (b) all land tenure 
types as recognized at the country level, such as freehold, leasehold, public land, customary land. An 
individual can hold land in his/her own name, jointly with other individuals, as a member of a household, 
or collectively as member of group1, cooperative or other type of association.  
 
Secure tenure rights: comprised of two sub-components: (i) legally recognized documentation and (ii) 
perception of the security of tenure, which are both necessary to provide a full measurement of tenure 
security.  
 
Legally recognized documentation: Legal documentation of rights refers to the recording and publication 
of information on the nature and location of land, rights and right holders in a form that is recognized by 
government, and is therefore official.  For purposes of computing SDG Indicator 1.4.2, the country 
specific metadata will define what documentation on land rights will be counted as legally recognized 
(see next section for rationale).  
 
Perceived security of tenure: Perception of tenure security refers to an individual’s perception of the 
likelihood of involuntary loss of land, such as disagreement of the ownership rights over land or ability to 
use it, regardless of the formal status and can be more optimistic or pessimistic. Although those without 
land rights’ documentation may frequently be perceived to be under threat, and those with 
documentation perceived as protected, there may be situations where documented land rights alone are 
insufficient to guarantee tenure security. Conversely, even without legally recognized documentation, 
individuals may feel themselves to be protected against eviction or dispossession. Therefore, capturing 
and analysing these diverse ranges of situations will enable a more comprehensive understanding of land 
tenure security, based on a country specific context.   
 
For purposes of constructing the indicator (see next section for rationale), we define perceptions of 
tenure to be secure if:  
(i) 
The landholder does not report a fear of involuntary loss of the land within the next five 
years due to, for example, intra-family, community or external threats and  
(ii) 
The landholder reports having the right to bequeath the land.  
 
Total adult population:  A country’s adult population2 is measured by census data or through surveys using 
an adequate sampling frame.   
 
Interpretation: 
One motivation that makes the indicator actionable is that, in many developing countries, the gap between 
data on the availability of documentation and on perception of tenure security can be large. For example, 
tenure may be perceived as secure, even though rights are not formally documented, as in the case of 
customary systems and trusted local land governance arrangements. Or, the opposite, tenure may be 
 
1 Group rights include shared or collective rights, and examples include the ejido in Mexico, indigenous territories in Honduras, perpetual 
DUAT for rural communities in Mozambique. Collective rights occur in a situation where holders of rights to land and natural resources are 
clearly defined as a collective group and have the right to exclude third parties from the enjoyment of those rights.    
2 Country specific legal definition of an ‘adult’ will be applied.

perceived as insecure even when there is a high level of formal documentation of rights. The latter situation 
can be caused by various factors, including limited trust in land administration services, possible duplicated 
documents, high cost of having state institutions protecting such rights.  
Reporting on perceived security will provide important information on people’s satisfaction with the 
institutional quality of service, transparency, appropriateness, accessibility and affordability of land 
administration services and justice systems.

Total official development assistance (ODA) grants from all donors that focus on poverty reduction as a 
share of the recipient country’s gross national income.  
 
The OECD/Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as “flows to countries and territories 
on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i)  provided by official 
agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii)  each transaction  
is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as 
its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent 
(calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See 
http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). 
 
Poverty reduction items can be defined as ODA to basic social services (basic health, basic education, 
basic water and sanitation, population programmes and reproductive health) and developmental food 
aid (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm). 
 
Rationale: 
 
Total ODA flows to developing countries quantify the public effort (excluding non- concessional flows and 
export credits), that all donors provide for the economic development and welfare of developing 
countries.  Within ODA, basic social services and development food aid focus on poverty alleviation in 
developing countries.

directly the monetary poor. Government spending measures public expenditures on health and 
education services. Direct transfers refer to cash transfers and near-cash transfers. The definition of the 
monetary poor follows national standards, with poverty levels determined by national definition of 
income or consumption poverty (consistent with SDG 1.2.1).  
 
Rationale: 
The indicator measures the extent to which public spending in three key areas which are critical for 
poverty eradication, including health, education, and other direct transfers is directly allocated to 
individuals or households in the monetary poor as per the national definition. 
The indicator measures if public spending is targeting the monetary poor. Pro-poor social spending is 
defined if the proportion of government expenditures on social services is higher than the proportion of 
the population, measured at the level determined by national definition of income/consumption poverty 
(consistent with SDG 1.2.1). For instance, if the proportion of public spending received by the poor 
exceeds (falls below) the proportion of poor as defined by national definitions, public expenditures can 
be interpreted as pro-poor (not pro-poor). This is a strong measurement of the financial commitment 
governments make to target their services and transfers on the poor groups of society, reinforcing pro-
poor development strategies.  
Further developments of the methodology and improvements in data availability may allow to expand 
this indicator to other vulnerable groups, such as women and children.

Rationale: 
Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome reflecting child nutritional status. Child stunting 
refers to a child who is too short for his or her age and is the result of chronic or recurrent malnutrition.

Rationale: 
Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome area reflecting child nutritional status. Child 
overweight refers to a child who is too heavy for his or her height. This form of malnutrition results from 
expending too few calories for the amount of food consumed and increases the risk of noncommunicable 
diseases later in life. Child overweight is one of the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators.

This implies the need to measure both the extent of land under productive and sustainable agriculture 
(the numerator), as well as the extent of agriculture land area (the denominator). 
 
• 
The numerator captures the three dimensions of sustainable production: environmental, 
economic and social. It corresponds to agricultural land area of the farms that satisfy the 
sustainability criteria of the 11 sub-indicators selected across all three dimensions. 
 
• 
The denominator in turn the sum of agricultural land area (as defined by FAO) utilized by 
agricultural holdings that are owned (excluding rented-out), rented-in, leased, sharecropped or 
borrowed. State or communal land used by farm holdings is not included. Please see the 
methodological document prepared by FAO for a more detailed explanation. 
 
The scope of indicator 2.4.1 is the agricultural farm holding, and more precisely the agricultural land area 
of the farm holding, i.e. land used primarily to grow crops and raise livestock. This choice of scope is fully 
consistent with the intended use of a country’s agricultural land area as the denominator of the 
aggregate indicator. Specifically the following are: 
 
Included within scope: 
• 
Intensive and extensive crops and livestock production systems. 
• 
Subsistence agriculture. 
• 
State and common land when used exclusively and managed by the farm holding. 
•

• 
Crops grown for fodder or for energy purposes. 
•

3.1.1,Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,"3.1 By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births",3.1.1 Maternal mortality ratio,SDG-indicator-pdfs/Metadata-03-01-01.pdf," 
The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time 
period per 100,000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death 
relative to the number of live births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy 
or a single live birth. 
Maternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by 
pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and 
childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the 
pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period. 
 
Rationale: 
 
All maternal mortality indicators derived from the 2019 estimation round include a point-estimate 
and an 80% uncertainty interval (UI). Data are available and can be downloaded from the webpage 
“maternal mortality – levels and trends 2000-2017: http://mmr2017.srhr.org. Both point-estimates 
and 80% UIs should be taken into account when assessing estimates. 
 
For example:  
The estimated 2017 global MMR is 211 (UI 199 to 243) 
 
This means: 
• The point-estimate is 211 and the 80% uncertainty interval ranges 199 to 243. 
• There is a 50% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies above 211, and a 50% chance that the 
true value lies below 211. 
• There is an 80% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies between 199 and 243. 
• There is still a 10% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies above 243, and a 10% chance that 
the true value lies below 199. 
 
Other accurate interpretations include: 
• We are 90% certain that the true 2017 global MMR is at least 199. 
• We are 90% certain that the true 2017 global MMR is 243 or less.

The amount of data available for estimating an indicator and the quality of that data determine the 
width of an indicator’s UI. As data availability and quality improve, the certainty increases that an 
indicator’s true value lies close to the point-estimate.

Rationale: 
 
Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child health and well-being, and, 
more broadly, for social and economic development. It is a closely watched public health indicator 
because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions such as 
vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition.

who received treatment in a year divided by the total number of people with substance use disorders in 
the same year. This indicator is disaggregated by two broad groups of psychoactive substances: (1) drugs, 
(2) alcohol and other psychoactive substances.  
 
Whenever possible, this indicator is additionally disaggregated by type of treatment interventions 
(pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services). The proposed indicator will be 
accompanied, with contextual information on availability coverage, i.e. treatment capacity for substance 
use disorders generated at national level to provide additional information for interpretation of the contact 
coverage data. 
 
Rationale: 
According to UNODC and WHO data, around 271 million people aged 15 to 64 years worldwide used an 
illicit drug at least once in 2017, about 2.3 billion people are current drinkers of alcohol, some 35 million of 
people suffer from drug use disorders and 289 million from alcohol use disorders. 
 
Substance use disorders are serious health conditions that present a significant burden for affected 
individuals, their families and communities. Untreated substance use disorders trigger substantial costs to 
society including lost productivity, increased health care expenditure, and costs related to criminal justice, 
social welfare, and other social consequences. Strengthening treatment services entails providing access 
to a comprehensive set of evidence-based interventions (-laid down in the international standards and 
guidelines) that should be available to all population groups in need. The indicator will inform the extent 
to which a range of evidence-based interventions for treatment of substance use disorder are available 
and are accessed by the population in need at country, regional and global level.  
 
Even though effective treatment exists, only a small amount of people with substance use disorders receive 
it. For instance, it is estimated that globally one out of 7 people with drug use disorders have access to or 
provided drug treatment services (World Drug Report 2019). WHO ATLAS-Substance Use data showed that 
in 2014 only 11.9 % (out of 103 responding) countries reported high coverage (40% or more) for alcohol

tracer interventions that include reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, 
non-communicable diseases and service capacity and access, among the general and the most 
disadvantaged population). 
 
The indicator is an index reported on a unitless scale of 0 to 100, which is computed as the geometric 
mean of 14 tracer indicators of health service coverage. 
 
Rationale: 
Target 3.8 is defined as “Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to 
quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential 
medicines and vaccines for all”.  The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality 
health services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. 
Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for 
health service coverage and indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household’s 
budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken together, indicators 
3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and financial protection dimensions, 
respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always monitored jointly. 
 
Countries provide many essential services for health protection, promotion, prevention, treatment and 
care. Indicators of service coverage – defined as people receiving the service they need – are the best 
way to track progress in providing services under universal health coverage (UHC). Since a single health 
service indicator does not suffice for monitoring UHC, an index is constructed from 14 tracer indicators 
selected based on epidemiological and statistical criteria. This includes several indicators that are already 
included in other SDG targets, thereby minimizing the data collection and reporting burden. The index is 
reported on a unitless scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the optimal value.

expenditure or income.  
 
Two thresholds are used to define “large household expenditure on health”: greater than 10% and 
greater than 25% of total household expenditure or income. 
  
Rationale: 
Target 3.8 is defined as “Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to 
quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential 
medicines and vaccines for all”.  The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality 
health services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. 
Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for 
health service coverage, which is operationalized with an index that combines 16 health service coverage 
indicators for reproductive, maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, 
and service capacity and access into a single summary metric. Indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health 
expenditures in relation to a household’s budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health 
care payments. Taken together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and 
financial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always 
monitored jointly. 
 
Indicator 3.8.2 derives from methodologies dating back to the 1990s developed in collaboration with 
academics at the World Bank and the World Health Organization. Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying 
people that need to devote a substantial share of their total household expenditure or income to health 
care. The focus is on payments made at the point of use to get any type of treatment, from any type of 
provider, for any type of disease or health problem, net of any reimbursements to the individual who 
made the payment but excluding pre-payments for health services; for example, in the form of taxes or 
specific insurance premiums or contributions. Such direct payments are the least equitable way to 
finance the health systems given that they determine the extent of care received.  
 
Last updated: March 2019 
 
 
This is clearly against the spirit of the target, which calls for granting access based on health needs not a 
household’s capacity to pull together all its financial resources to meet the health needs of its members. 
Some direct payments might be needed but indicator 3.8.2 is underpinned by the conviction that no one, 
at whatever income level, should have to choose between spending on health and spending on other 
basic goods and services such as education tuitions, food necessities, housing and utilities. One way of 
assessing the extent to which health systems lead to financial hardship is to calculate the proportion of 
the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of household total consumption 
or income.  For detailed information on the definition chosen to monitor the financial protection 
dimension of universal health coverage within the SDG monitoring framework (indicator 3.8.2) please

health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report”.

The mortality attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution can be expressed as: 
Number of deaths, Death rate. Death rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total 
population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years). 
 
Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution is linked, among others, 
to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate: 
 
- Acute respiratory infections in young children (estimated under 5 years of age); 
- Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25 years); 
- Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); 
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); and 
- Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years). 
 
Rationale: 
 
As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the mortality resulting from exposure 
to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuel use for cooking 
was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and 
trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these 
pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is 
understood as wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes, as well as kerosene. 
Air pollution is the biggest environmental risk to health. The majority of the burden is borne by the 
populations in low and middle-income countries.

population, and multiplied by 100,000. 
 
Rationale: 
 
The indicator expresses the number of deaths from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (with focus 
on WASH services) which could be prevented by improving those services and practices. It is based on 
both the WASH service provision in the country, as well as the related health outcomes, and therefore 
provides important information on the actual disease caused by the risks measured in 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.

The indicator is defined as the percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who currently use 
any tobacco product (smoked and/or smokeless tobacco) on a daily or non-daily basis.  
 
 
Rationale:  
Tobacco use is a major contributor to illness and death from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). There is 
no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure.  All daily and non-daily users of 
tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing 
the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality 
from NCDs (Target 3.4). Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate 
monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on 
Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the 
WHO FCTC, over time. Tobacco use prevalence levels are an appropriate indicator of implementation of 
SDG Target 3.a “Strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework 
Convention on Tobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate”.

Coverage of HPV vaccine (last dose in the schedule): Percentage of 15 years old girls received the 
recommended doses of HPV vaccine. Currently performance of the programme in the previous calendar 
year based on target age group is used. 
 
Rationale: 
This indicator aims to measure access to vaccines, including the newly available or underutilized vaccines, 
at the national level. In the past decades all countries added numerous new and underutilised vaccines in 
their national immunization schedule and there are several vaccines under final stage of development to 
be introduced by 2030. For monitoring diseases control and impact of vaccines it is important to measure 
coverage from each vaccine in national immunization schedule and the system is already in place for all 
national programmes, however direct measurement for proportion of population covered with all 
vaccines in the programme is only feasible if the country has a well-functioning national nominal 
immunization registry, usually an electronic one that will allow this coverage to be easily estimated. 
While countries will develop and strengthen immunization registries it is a need for an alternative 
measurement.

affordable on a sustainable basis. 
The indicator is a multidimensional index reported as a proportion (%) of health facilities that have a 
defined core set of quality-assured medicines that are available and affordable relative to the total 
number of surveyed health facilities at national level. 
 
Rationale: 
Measurement and monitoring of access to essential medicines are of high priority for the global 
development agenda given access is an integral part of the Universal Health Coverage movement 
and an indispensable element of the delivery of quality health care. Access to medicines is a 
composite multidimensional concept that is composed of the availability of medicines and the 
affordability of their prices. Information on these two dimensions has been collected and analysed 
since the 54th World Health Assembly in 2001, when Member States adopted the WHO Medicines 
Strategy (resolution WHA54.11). This resolution led to the launch of the joint project on Medicine 
Prices and Availability by WHO and the international non-governmental organization Health Action 
International (HAI/WHO), as well as a proposed HAI/WHO methodology for collecting data and 
measuring components of access to medicines. To this day, this methodology has been widely 
implemented to produce useful analyses of availability and affordability of medicines, however the 
two dimensions have been evaluated separately. 
While the above approach has provided an overview of the countries’ performance and progress on 
improving the affordability and availability of medicines, it has not allowed evaluation of overall 
access to medicines. 
This evaluation is in turn essential as country’s success in ensuring one of the dimensions (e.g. 
availability) does not necessarily indicate the realization of the other (e.g. affordability) and vice 
versa. For example, a country may focus its policy efforts on ensuring the availability of a core set of 
essential medicines in the event of low capacity of local production and/or challenges associated 
with geographic location. As a result of the proposed policies, medicines may become available but

their prices may not be affordable. The opposite situation is also possible, as lowering prices of 
medicines to increase affordability may be too restrictive for some pharmaceutical producers and 
lead to a decreased supply. Therefore, given the multidimensionality of access to medicines, it is 
necessary to evaluate both affordability and availability of medicines at the same time. 
The proposed methodology for indicator 3.b.3 allows the combination of both dimensions into a 
single indicator to evaluate the availability and affordability of medicines simultaneously. This 
methodology also allows for disaggregation so that each dimension can be analysed separately and 
the main driver of poor performance of the overall index can be properly identified. 
Monitoring the core set of relevant essential medicines is based on the WHO Model List of Essential 
Medicines (EML). The 2017 WHO EML contains 433 medications deemed essential for addressing the 
most important public health needs globally. The current index is computed based on a subset of 32 
tracer essential medicines for the treatment, prevention and management of acute and chronic, 
communicable and non-communicable diseases in a primary health care setting.

1 The official indicator name refers to ‘female genital mutilation/cutting’, or FGM/C. In recent years the 
convention within UNICEF and partner organizations has shifted to referring to ‘female genital mutilation’, or 
FGM, a term which is now used interchangeably with FGM/C throughout the metadata. Other common terms 
for the practice include ‘female circumcision’ and ‘excision’. The custodian will request the IAEG-SDGs to 
consider a refinement of the indicator name to reflect this change for consideration at the UN Statistical 
Commission in 2022.  
Last updated: March 2021 
This indicator can be measured among smaller age groups, with the experience of younger women 
representing FGM/C that has occurred more recently and the experience of older women representing 
levels of the practice in the past. At the regional and global level, this indicator is currently being reported 
as the proportion of adolescent girls aged 15-19 years who have undergone female genital mutilation.

in (total) management and the share of females in senior and middle management (thus excluding junior 
management). The joint calculation of these two measures provides information on whether women are 
more represented in junior management than in senior and middle management, thus pointing to an 
eventual ceiling for women to access higher-level management positions. In these cases, calculating only 
the share of women in (total) management would be misleading, in that it would suggest that women 
hold positions with more decision-making power and responsibilities than they actually do.

Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services is currently being measured by the 
proportion of population using an improved basic drinking water source which is located on premises, 
available when needed and free of faecal (and priority chemical) contamination. ‘Improved’ drinking 
water sources include: piped water into dwelling, yard or plot; public taps or standpipes; boreholes or 
tubewells; protected dug wells; protected springs; packaged water; delivered water and rainwater. 
 
Rationale: 
 
MDG target 7C called for ‘sustainable access’ to ‘safe drinking water’. At the start of the MDG period, 
there was a complete lack of nationally representative data about drinking water safety in developing 
countries, and such data were not collected through household surveys or censuses. The JMP developed 
the concept of ‘improved’ water sources, which was used as a proxy for ‘safe water’, as such sources are 
likely to be protected against faecal contamination, and this metric has been used since 2000 to track 
progress towards the MDG target. International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on 
the need to build on and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative 
criteria of the human right to water including accessibility, availability and quality. 
 
The above consultation concluded that JMP should go beyond the basic level of access and address safe 
management of drinking water services, including dimensions of accessibility, availability and quality. The 
proposed indicator of ‘safely managed drinking water services’ is designed to address this.

The Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility 
with soap and water is currently being measured by the proportion of the population using a basic 
sanitation facility which is not shared with other households and where excreta is safely disposed in situ 
or treated off-site. ‘Improved’ sanitation facilities include: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, 
septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting 
toilets.  
 
Population with a basic handwashing facility: a device to contain, transport or regulate the flow of water 
to facilitate handwashing with soap and water in the household. 
 
Rationale: 
 
MDG target 7C called for ‘sustainable access’ to ‘basic sanitation’. The JMP developed the metric of use 
of ‘improved’ sanitation facilities, which are likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human 
contact, and has used this indicator to track progress towards the MDG target since 2000. International 
consultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the 
shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water 
including accessibility, acceptability, and safety. Furthermore, the safe management of faecal wastes 
should be considered, as discharges of untreated wastewater into the environment create public health 
hazards. 
 
The above consultation concluded that post-2015 targets, which apply to all countries, should go beyond 
the basic level of access and address indicators of safe management of sanitation services, including 
dimensions of accessibility, acceptability and safety. The Expert Working Group called for analysis of 
faecal waste management along the sanitation chain, including containment, emptying of latrines and 
septic tanks, and safe on-site disposal or the transport and treatment of wastes at a designated

treatment site. Classification of treatment will be based on categories defined by SEEA and the 
International Recommendations for Water Statistics and following a laddered approach (primary, 
secondary and tertiary treatment). 
 
Handwashing with soap is widely agreed to be the top hygiene priority for improving health outcomes. In 
2008 and 2009, the JMP supported a review of indicators of handwashing practice, and determined that 
the most practical approach leading to reliable measurement of handwashing in national household 
surveys was observation of the place where household members wash their hands and noting the 
presence of water and soap (or local alternative) at that location. This provides a measure of whether 
households have the necessary tools for handwashing and is a proxy for their behaviour. Observation by 
survey enumerators represents a more reliable, valid and efficient indicator for measuring handwashing 
behaviour than asking individuals to report their own behaviour.

6.3.1,Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all,"6.3 By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally",6.3.1 Proportion of domestic and industrial wastewater flows safely treated,SDG-indicator-pdfs/Metadata-06-03-01.pdf," 
This indicator measures the volumes of wastewater which are generated through different activities, and 
the volumes of wastewater which are safely treated before discharge into the environment. Both of 
these indicators are measured in units of 1000 m3/day, although some data sources may use other units 
that require conversion. The ratio of the volume treated to the volume generated is taken as the 
‘proportion of wastewater flow safely treated’.  
 
Wastewater flows will be classified into industrial, services, and domestic flows, with reference to the  
International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities Revision 4 (ISIC). To the extent 
possible, the proportion of each of these waste streams that is safely treated before discharge to the 
environment will be calculated. 
 
Rationale: 
Wastewater data are crucial to promote strategies for sustainable and safe wastewater use or reuse 
to the benefit of the world’s population health and the global environment, but also to respond to 
growing water demands, increasing water pollution loads, and climate change impacts on water 
resources. 
 
Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) is about ensuring the availability and sustainability of water 
and sanitation for all by 2030. SDG Target 6.3 sets out to improve ambient water quality, which is 
essential to protecting both ecosystem and human health, by eliminating, minimizing and 
significantly reducing different streams of pollution into water bodies. 
 
The purpose of monitoring progress using SDG indicator 6.3.1 is to provide necessary and timely 
information to decision makers and stakeholders to make informed decisions to accelerate progress

Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-
coordinated spending plan is defined as the proportion of total water and sanitation-related Official 
Development Assistance (ODA) disbursements that are included in the government budget. 
 
Rationale: 
 
The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) is a quantifiable 
measurement as a proxy for “international cooperation and capacity development support” in financial 
terms. It is essential to be able to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is included in the 
government budget to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned with national 
governments while highlighting total water and sanitation ODA disbursements to developing countries 
over time.  
 
A low value of this indicator (near 0%) would suggest that international donors are investing in water and 
sanitation related activities and programmes in the country outside the purview of the national 
government. A high value (near 100%) would indicate that donors are aligned with national government 
and national policies and plans for water and sanitation.

The indicator assesses the percentage of local administrative units (as defined by the national 
government) that have an established and operational mechanism by which individuals and communities 
can meaningfully contribute to decisions and directions about water and sanitation management. 
 
The indicator Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and 
procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is currently being 
measured by the Proportion of countries with clearly defined procedures in law or policy for participation 
by service users/communities in planning program in water and sanitation management, and hygiene 
promotion and the Proportion of countries with high level of users/communities participating in planning 
programs in water and sanitation management, and hygiene promotion. 
 
Rationale: 
 
Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure the 
needs of all the community are met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of 
schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability. 
 
A low value of this indicator would suggest that participation of local communities in water and sanitation 
management is low, whereas a high value would indicate high levels of participation, indicating greater 
ownership and a higher likelihood of sustainable delivery and management of water and sanitation 
services.

population that lives within 2 km of an all-season road.  
 
Rationale: 
Among other factors, transport connectivity is an essential part of the enabling environment for inclusive 
and sustained growth. In developing countries, particularly in Africa, the vast majority of agricultural 
production remains smallholder farming with limited access to local, regional, or global markets. Isolated 
manufacturing and other local businesses (except for those related to mining) often lag behind in the 
global market. Limited transport connectivity is also a critical constraint to accessing social and 
administrative services, especially in rural areas where the majority of the poor live.  
 
Rural access is key to unleashing untapped economic potential and eradicating poverty in many 
developing countries. In the short term, transport costs and travel time can be reduced by improved road 
conditions. Over the longer term, agricultural productivity will be increased, and firms will become more 
profitable with the creation of more jobs, eventually helping to alleviate poverty.  
 
To make good investments, quality data are required. Since resources are limited, it is essential to 
understand where the most critical unmet needs exist, and monitor efforts made over time. In the 
transport sector, there are few global indicators. The quality of roads is often unknown and a matter of 
concern in developing countries. In Africa, the Road Management Initiative, started by the Africa 
Transport Policy Program in the late 1990s, developed a road sector database, which includes road 
network condition data such as the share of roads in good or bad condition. But this database is largely 
outdated and insufficient.  
 
The Rural Access Index (RAI), originally developed by the World Bank in 2006, is among the most 
important global development indicators in the transport sector, providing a strong, clearly 
understandable and conceptually consistent indicator across countries. It measures the proportion of 
people living in rural areas who have access to an all-season road within a walking distance of 
approximately 2 kilometres (km). Although the underlying methodology has been updated to leverage 
Last updated: September 2020 
 
additional sources of data, the RAI remains the most widely accepted metric for tracking access to 
transport in rural areas.  
 
The RAI has four primary benefits: sustainability due to its reliance on already existing data, consistency 
in methodology across countries and time, simplicity in understanding, and operational relevance for the 
government agencies responsible for generating and aggregating the underlying data.

Passenger and freight volumes are respectively measured in passenger-km and tonne-km, and broken 
down by mode of transport. For the purposes of monitoring this indicator, passenger-km data are split 
between aviation, road (broken down between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles) and rail, and 
tonne-km are split between aviation, road, rail and inland waterways.  
As maritime data are not widely available, only tonnes (rather than tonne-km) data at the regional level 
have been shared. 
 
 
Rationale: 
 
Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and trans-border 
infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and 
equitable access for all. Trans-border infrastructure development is best captured by passenger and 
freight volumes moved by Member States and Regions. A growth in passenger and freight volumes shows 
a robust infrastructure development happening in States and Regions along with the resultant socio-
economic benefit. Air Transport is particularly important not only for the economic and job benefits but 
also because it is one of the only mode of transport that can be relied on during emergencies and disease 
outbreaks to reach food, medicines, medical personnel, vaccines and other supplies speedily to the 
affected persons in the affected areas. In addition, tracking how the non-road share of freight volumes, 
and the public transport share of passenger volumes, changes over time allows insights into the overall 
sustainability of the global transport system.

- Nonperforming loans to total gross loans  
5 
- Return on assets  
6 
- Liquid assets to short-term liabilities  
7 
- Net open position in foreign exchange to capital  
 
Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) 
assets.   
  
Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as 
the numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in 
accordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III.  
  
Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of 
nonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as 
the denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital.  
  
Nonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the 
numerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific 
loan- loss provisions) as the denominator.  
  
Return on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and 
taxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) 
over the same period.  
  
Liquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as 
the numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking 
the broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, 
this indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. 
  
Net open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be 
calculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital 
should be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.

10.7.3,Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries,"10.7 Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies",10.7.3 Number of people who died or disappeared in the process of migration towards an international destination,SDG-indicator-pdfs/Metadata-10-07-03.pdf,"The MMP data include migrants (regardless of legal status) who have died at the external borders of States 
or in the process of migration towards an international destination. This selection of data is based on the 
currently available sources and can provide some insight into the safety or otherwise of routes. Not 
included in the data collection is information about migrants who die, or go missing, in countries of 
destination or residence. Deaths in refugee housing, immigration detention centres or camps are excluded. 
The MMP data also exclude deaths that occur during deportation or after forced return to a migrant’s 
homeland or third country, as well as deaths more loosely connected with migrants’ precarious or irregular 
status, such as those resulting from labour exploitation or resulting from lack of access to health care.  
Rationale: 
The research behind the MMP began with the October 2013 tragedies, when at least 368 individuals died 
in two shipwrecks near the Italian island of Lampedusa. The MMP data aims to bear witness to the global 
phenomenon of migrant deaths, and is the only global database on this topic. It is hoped that by counting 
and accounting for these deaths, almost all of which are linked to irregular migration, policymakers, 
academics, and the general public will be better informed about the risks linked to unsafe migration.  
Given that there are few official sources of data on deaths during migration, these data are best understood 
as a minimum estimate of the true number of migrant deaths worldwide. The MMP collects data from a 
variety of sources, which change over time given the large geography covered and the politicization of 
irregular migration – notably the criminalization of search and rescue actors in the Mediterranean and US-
Mexico border – which affect access to relevant information. With this in mind, these data are best 
understood as indicative of the global nature of migrant fatalities, and should not be used to identify trends 
over time outside of the US-Mexico border, where official data is more frequently available compared to 
other areas of the world.

countries and developing countries corresponding to a 0% tariff rate in HS chapter 01-97. 
 
Rationale: 
 
The calculation of this indicator will allow observing on how many products Developing countries and 
LDCs will have free access to Developed countries markets. When compared to the tariff rates applied to 
other countries, this indicator will allow assessing to which extent special and differential treatment has 
been accorded in terms of import tariffs. The evolution of this indicator will indicate progress on the

10.c.1,Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries,"10.c By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent",10.c.1 Remittance costs as a proportion of the amount remitted,SDG-indicator-pdfs/Metadata-10-0C-01.pdf,"The target includes two components. The first component is that transaction costs for migrant 
remittances should be 3% or less by 2030. This transaction cost should be intended as “Global average 
total cost of sending $200 (or equivalent in local sending currency) and expressed as % of amount 
sent”. This indicator is readily available and published on a quarterly basis by the World Bank in the 
Remittance Prices Worldwide database, which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending to 105 
receiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where cost is 5% or higher. This 
should be intended in the sense that it should be possible for remittance senders to send money to the 
beneficiary for an average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should suffice that in 
each corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a defined set of service requirements (including 
service quality, reach etc.), for which the average is 5% or less. 
 
Rationale: 
Data for these indicators have been collected by the World Bank through the Remittance Prices 
Worldwide (RPW) database since 2008 for the purpose of monitoring the G8 / G20 target on reducing 
remittance prices. Also known as the “5x5 objective”, this goal was adopted by the G8 in 2009, and it 
refers to reduction of the global average total cost of migrant remittances by 5 percentage points in 5 
years. To achieve this objective, the governments in both sending and receiving countries should consider 
implementing reforms based upon the General Principles for International Remittances Services by the 
World Bank/Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (January 2007). This internationally agreed 
framework has proven effective in helping reduce the cost of remittances and guiding actions to enhance 
the efficiency of international remittances. The World Bank’s RPW database is the only global database 
that monitors remittance prices across all regions of the world. RPW was launched by the World Bank in 
September 2008, and is a key tool in monitoring the evolution of costs to the remitters and the 
beneficiaries from sending and receiving money in major country corridors.

They provide 
development services and humanitarian relief, innovate in service delivery, build local capacity and 
advocate with and for the poor. Acting alone, however, their impact is limited in scope, scale and 
sustainability. CSOs need to engage in government policy processes more effectively. The development of 
sustainable human settlements calls for the active engagement of all key stakeholders with particular 
attention to project/programme beneficiaries and vulnerable groups.  Therefore local and national 
governments should strive to: a) facilitate and protect people’s participation and civic engagement 
through independent civil society organizations that can be from diverse backgrounds - local, national, 
and international; b) promote civic and human rights education and training programmes to make urban 
residents aware of their rights and the changing roles of diverse women, men, and young women and 
men in urban settings; c) remove the barriers that block participation of socially marginalized groups and 
promote non-discrimination and the full and equal participation of women, young men and women and 
marginalized groups. To monitor this indicator fully, it is important to define cities as unique entities and 
define what constitutes direct participation structures of civil society. Urban planning and management 
are more clear concepts that UN-Habitat has worked on developing for the last few decades and these 
are well articulated in the urban agenda documents. Experts who have worked on the methodological 
developments of this indicator have there put forth the below definitions to help guide the work on this 
indicator. 
 
Rationale: 
This indicator measures the progress and willingness of elected officials, urban managers and planners to 
integrate resident and civil society participation in urban planning and management at various levels. 
Local authorities and governments, along with the international community, are increasingly recognizing 
the value of civil society and residents’ participation in strengthening the urban development processes. 
This people-centered approach is key in guiding urban development processes for local ownership, and 
the implementation of community projects at citywide or local levels. 
 
Civil society and public participation fosters a positive relationship between government and the public 
by communicating effectively and solving the conflicts in a cooperative manner. In many cases when 
urban planning decisions are made without consultation, the desired results are not achieved and there is 
a negative impact on society, due to inefficient allocation and use of resources. Ensuring that wide 
Last updated: November 2018 
 
varieties of opinions are considered assists the decision makers with understanding the interlinkages and 
nature of problems and potential solutions facing different urban settings.  
 
Urban development is a reflection of ideology and national institutions. Public participation means a 
broader consensus is built and this greatly enhances political interaction between citizens and 
government, and enhances the legitimacy of the planning process and the plan itself. A plan is more 
effective if a broad coalition supports the proposal and works together to deliver it.  
 
Civil society and public participation in urban management and governance also shows respect to 
participants’ opinion, needs, aspirations and assets. It can boost their enthusiasm for citizenship and 
politics, and strengthens their influence in urban planning and public life. When conflicting claims and 
views are considered, there is a much higher possibility that public trust and buy-in increases in the 
outcome. This has broader implications for building an active, inclusive and equitable society and more 
inclusive and sustainable urban environments.

the progress of the performance of a city’s municipal solid waste management. It quantifies the 
parameters listed below, which are essential for planning and implementing sustainable Municipal Solid 
Waste (MSW). In most cases, these variables are generally compatible with those collected through the 
UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics (waste section). 
a) Total MSW generated in the city (tonnes/day) 
b) Total MSW collected in the city (tonnes/day) 
c) Proportion of population with access to basic MSW collection services in the city (%) 
d) Total MSW managed in controlled facilities in the city (tonnes/day) 
e) MSW composition 
It is important to realize that part (b) total MSW collected and (c) proportion of the population with 
access to basic MSW collection services are two different concepts. While part (b) refers to amounts of 
waste reaching waste management facilities, part (c) considers the population who receive waste 
collection services. In some cities it is common to dump waste ‘collected’ from households into the 
surrounding areas instead of transporting it to a disposal or recovery facility. In this case the household 
has waste collection services, but the collected waste is polluting the environment. Therefore, it is 
possible that a city has a high proportion of population with access to basic waste collection services, but 
the amount of MSW collected and transported to waste management facilities is low.  
Although part (c)  is covered by SDG 1 (“End poverty in all its forms everywhere”), under target 1.4 and 
SDG indicator 1.4.1 which focuses on universal access to basic services, with a particular emphasis on 
poor and vulnerable groups, this document provides guidelines, quality ladders and household 
questionnaires to measure the proportion of the population with access to ‘basic’ MSW collection 
services. The household questionnaire can be integrated into the national census or global household 
survey mechanism such as Demographic and Health Survey or UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster 
Surveys. Due to the lack of standardized concepts and definitions that differentiate these two concepts, 
many cities report the proportion of collected MSW in their own terms. Therefore, this metadata 
distinguishes clearly between part (b) and (c) and offers introduction to the approaches to monitor and 
report on part (c).

Rationale: 
Urban households and businesses produce substantial amounts of solid waste that must be collected 
regularly, recycled or treated and disposed properly in order to maintain healthy and sanitary living 
conditions. Many cities are increasingly facing solid waste management challenges due to rapid 
urbanization, lack of technical and financial capacity or low policy priority. In addition, the higher the 
income level of a city, the greater the amount of the solid waste produced. Therefore, the economic 
growth to be experienced in the developing and emerging countries will pose greater challenges in solid 
waste management to local governments in the next decades. 
 
Adverse environmental impact of uncollected waste in a city is significant. Uncollected solid waste can 
end up in drains leading to blocked drainages and cause unsanitary conditions that have a direct health 
impact on residents. Open burning of uncollected waste produces pollutants that are highly damaging 
locally and globally. Vectors such as mosquitos usually breed in blocked drainages and blocked drainage 
contributes to the cause of flooding. In 2015, the Global Waste Management Outlook estimated that at 
least 2 billion people do not have access to regular waste collection. This is particularly worse in informal 
settlements and the UN-Habitat’s report Solid Waste Management in World Cities published in 2010 
estimated only 5% of waste in squatter areas is regularly collected.   
 
The global scale of urbanization and economic growth are creating a potential “time-bomb” regarding the 
waste we generate in the world. If not addressed now, the significant negative impact on human health 
and the environment will be felt by nations at all levels of development. An estimated 2 billion tonnes of 
municipal solid waste (MSW) were generated in 2016, and this number is expected to grow to 3.4 billion 
tonnes by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario (Worldbank, 2018). Uncontrolled disposal sites are 
already a major source of Green House Gases (GHG), and if we continue on the current path the waste 
sector, particularly food waste, is predicted to account for 8-10% of global anthropogenic GHG emission 
by 2025. Additionally, every year at least 8 million tonnes of plastic find its way into the world’s oceans 
(Jambeck et al., 2015). 
There is a need for SDG indicator 11.6.1 monitoring as it provides critical information for cities and 
countries to establish better waste and resource management strategies. Reliable data and information 
on MSW generation and management is limited globally, especially in low- and middle-income country 
settings where waste data is often produced based on international estimates, without having been 
validated in the local context.  
Many developing and transitional country cities still have an active informal sector and micro-enterprise 
recycling, reuse and repair; often achieve recycling and recovery rates comparable to those in developed 
countries, resulting in savings to the waste management budget of the cities. There is a major 
opportunity for the city to build on these existing recycling systems, reducing some unsustainable 
practices and enhancing them to protect and develop people’s livelihoods, and to reduce still further the 
costs to the city of managing the residual wastes. The formal and informal sectors need to work together, 
for the benefit of both. Promoting this indicator also can help formalization of the informal sector in the 
process of increasing the portion of ‘solid waste with adequate discharge’.  
 
A global data collection and publication system through the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment 
Statistics has collected data on MSW collection and treatment for about 20 years. The Questionnaire has 
been sent to more than 160 countries, covering both national and city levels. However, the response rate 
Last updated: 15 September 2020 
for the UNSD/UNEP questionnaire is around 50% and data completeness and quality remain a challenge, 
especially for developing countries. While efforts will continue to collect data from National Statistical 
Offices and Ministries of Environment at the national level, it is also critical to improve the availability and 
accessibility of waste statistics and increase training for collection of data and capacity development at 
the national and sub-national levels. 
This paucity of evidence-based data hinders the development of waste management strategies and 
constrains investment decision-making in infrastructure and service expansion, leading to many countries 
having insufficient or absent MSW management services. Poor MSW collection and management trigger 
severe threats to public health and pollute air and water. Furthermore, uncollected and mismanaged 
waste is the main source of marine plastic pollution. 
The indicator 11.6.1 will also promote Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM). An integrated solid 
waste management system is strongly connected to three dimensions: urban environmental health, the 
environment and resource management. Moreover, a regular solid waste management strategy is a clear 
indicator of the effectiveness of a municipal administration. Good waste governance that is inclusive, 
financially sustainable and based on sound institutions is one of the key challenges of the 21st century, 
and one of the key responsibilities of a city government. 
 
SDG indicator 11.6.1 quantifies parameters that will help cities and countries to better manage resources, 
mitigate and prevent environmental pollution, create business, employment and livelihood 
opportunities, and shift towards a circular economy. The methodology to monitor SDG indicator 11.6.1 
provides guidelines for ladders for MSW collection services and control level of waste management 
facilities and aims to bring standardization around MSW data points. 
The indicator 11.6.1 has strong linkages to other SDG indicators such as 6.3.1 (proportion of wastewater 
safely treated), 12.3.1 (food waste), 12.4.2 (Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of 
hazardous waste treated and by type of treatment) and 12.5.1 (National recycling rate).   
UN-Habitat has also developed an additional document Waste Wise Cities Tool - Step by Step Guide to 
Assess a City’s MSWM Performance through SDG indicator 11.6.1 Monitoring which provides detailed 
methodology for data collection if not available.

Besides the emotional and psychological harm suffered, harassment can have negative consequences on 
the ability of its victims to fully participate in public life and to share in and contribute to the development 
of their communities. For example, the widespread occurrence of sexual harassment in the workplace can 
lead to a lower participation of women in the workforce, especially in male-dominated occupations, and

A National Urban Policy (NUP) is defined as a coherent set of decisions or principle of actions derived through 
a deliberate government led process of coordinating and rallying various actors for a common vision and goal 
that will promote more transformative, productive, inclusive, and resilient urban development for the long 
term1.  
This standard definition is extended and adapted to country contexts and may include, where applicable terms 
such as National Urban Plan, Framework, or Strategy as long as they are aligned with the above qualifiers.  
Similarly, regional development plans follow the same definition, only applied at the subnational level.  
 
NUP that responds to population dynamics:   
This first qualifier examines to what extent the NUP addresses issues to do with population composition, 
trends and projections in achieving development goals and targets.  
- 
Population composition includes size, geographic distribution and density, household size and 
composition, mobility and migration, age and sex distribution and disaggregation, as specified in SDG 
target 17.18  
- 
Trends are changes in composition of the population from over time  
- 
Projections are expected changes over time that the NUP needs to ensure that they are well addressed. 
 
Key questions for the assessment:  
- 
To what extent are quality and timely data on urban and rural population composition, trends and 
projections available for use in the development, implementation and monitoring of NUP or Regional 
Development Plans (RDPs)?  
- 
To what extent do the strategies/interventions of the NUP and/or RDPs refer to population composition,

Local fiscal space is understood as the sum of financial resources available for improved delivery of basic social 
and economic services at the local level as a result of the budget and related decisions by governments at all 
levels without any prejudice to the sustainability of a government’s financial position.  
 
Key questions for the assessment:  
- 
To what extent has the policy made allowance for the provision of local financial resources to provide for 
the implementation of the policy and for the delivery of essential basic social and economic services  
- 
To what extent has the policy assessed the status of human capacities required to effectively use financial 
resources for the implementation of the policy and the delivery of essential basic social and economic 
services?  
 
Developing:  
Developing refers to the policy development pathways and processes that consider the feasibility, diagnosis of 
policy problems and opportunities, the formulation/drafting of the policy until the approval of the policy  
 
Implementing:  
Implementation refers to the realization of the policy proposal through legislative or financial 
action/commitments, including the continued monitoring and evaluation of that policy  
 
Rationale: 
National Urban Policies can help achieve target 11.a.1  
 
This indicator is based on the notion that the development and implementation of National Urban Policies 
should support participation, partnership, cooperation and coordination of actors as well as facilitate dialogue. 
National Urban Policy (NUP) and Regional Development Plans (RDP) promote coordinated and connected 
urban development. A coordinated effort from government through a NUP or RDP provides the best 
opportunity for achieving sustainable urbanization and balanced territorial development by linking sectorial 
policies, connecting national, regional and local government policies, strengthening urban, peri-urban and 
rural links through balanced territorial development.   
  
This indicator provides a good barometer on global progress on sustainable national urban policies. It serves as 
gap analysis to support policy recommendations. The indicator can identify good practices and policies among 
countries that can promote partnership and cooperation between all stakeholders. This indicator is both 
process oriented and aspirational and has the potential to support the validation of Goal 11 and other SDGs 
indicators with an urban component. The indicator has the ability to be applicable at multi jurisdictions levels, 
i.e covering a number of areas while taking care of urban challenges in a more integrated national manner.  
 
The explicit introduction of National Urban Policy in the wording of indicator 11.a.1 brings emphasis to a policy 
process that can better satisfy the requirements of target 11.a through sectorial, territorial and jurisdictional 
integration and coordination steered by the national level.  This is so because, evidence shows that NUP can 
support positive economic, social and environmental links by ensuring at the highest level of government the 
coherent alignment of sectorial policies to support sustainable and inclusive urbanization2. With the World 
increasingly urbanizing, it is becoming clear today that how cities are managed and planned has ramifications 
well beyond their boundaries and that urbanization is a key force for national and sustainable development.  
 
Urbanization has indeed historically been a catalyst for economic growth and social progress, and even holds 
the possibility for the protection and more efficient use of natural resources, and climate change mitigation

and adaptation. However, this positive impact is not automatic, particularly in developing countries - where 
rapid and/or unplanned urbanization can bring about negative economic, social and environmental 
externalities with increasing congestion, sprawl, informality, social exclusion and conflict – if the provision of 
services and infrastructure does not keep up with natural and internal population growth , equitable 
distribution, migration patterns to the city, etc. Governments need to be sensitive to this fact that urbanization 
is a nation-wide and multi-sectorial issue. Therefore, NUPs provide the framework to harness urbanization 
dividends and mitigate its negative externalities.  A national urban policy calls attention to the impact of 
sectorial governmental policies on the sustainable development of cities and encourages and enables the 
vertical and horizontal coordination of government departments and their policies to best support it.  
 
This consideration in turn also encourages more cooperation and coordination between different levels of 
government to support the development and implementation of a national vision for urban development, 
effectively strengthening national and regional development planning. The urban policy process is led at the 
national level to ensure the articulation and coordination of different sectors and government levels but 
engages both top down and bottom up processes. For a successful implementation, a NUP must create an 
enabling, collaborative and cooperative institutional environment, mobilizing different levels, assessing and 
building their capacities, and establishing jointly defined and transparent responsibilities for implementation. 
Subnational governments are key implementation partner due to their proximity to citizens and role in 
delivering services and infrastructure. As such, a NUP does not replace regional and local development policies 
and plans but strengthens them and relies on their horizontal alignment and vertical articulation, especially to 
tackle cross boundary challenges such as sustainable resource management, infrastructure development, 
climate change adaptation and mitigation, or urban-rural linkages.  
 
Finally, NUP as an overarching framework articulating and aligning subnational and local plans and policies 
under a common vision for urbanization that also makes it particularly suited to consider the urban-peri-
urban-rural continuum. This urban and rural consideration is a key element of data disaggregation and 
administrative delineation in territorial planning. However, the importance of urban-rural linkages (through 
flows of people, natural resources, capital, goods, ecosystem services, information, technology, ideas and 
innovation) is increasingly being acknowledged for sustainable and integrated territorial development. The 
New Urban Agenda (NUA) for instance stresses the need to reduce urban and rural disparities to foster 
equitable development and encourage connectivity. Target 11.a is the only one that explicitly considers urban, 
peri-urban and rural areas under a city-centric SDG 11. NUP is the adequate framework to strengthen and 
direct urban and rural flows towards the most sustainable patterns of consumption and equitable resource 
distribution, as they can strike the balance between competition and solidarity between territories of a 
country.  
 
Urban Policies are more broadly instrumental for the implementation and monitoring of global agendas  
National Urban Policies therefore enable a cross-sectorial approach, and the horizontal and vertical 
institutional coordination needed to address the challenges and opportunities of urbanization, which are 
increasingly recognized as going beyond the boundaries of the city. Intergovernmental agreements have 
indeed shown a new interest in urbanization for sustainable development. This is illustrated of course in 
Agenda 2030 with its introduction of a standalone urban SDG-11, but many other SDGs also have clear urban 
dimensions and implications. Following the Agenda 2030, the United Nations Conference on Housing and 
Sustainable Development (Habitat III) adopted the New Urban Agenda, a roadmap for the next 20 years setting 
new global standards for sustainable urban development. Finally, although the Paris Agreement on Climate 
Change does not explicitly mention cities, the management of urbanization is still essential to addressing 
climate change, as is illustrated by the fact that two third of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions 
contain clear urban references and content3. As an instrument for governments to harness the dynamics of 
urbanization for national development, NUPs have therefore been identified as a key tool for the 
implementation and monitoring of such agendas.  
 
The Policy Paper on National Urban Policies prepared for Habitat III for instance explained that a NUP should 
constitute an important part of any serious attempt to implement the SDGs and should become a key

instrument to measure the achievement of the SDGs. As explained above, NUPs are a particularly appropriate 
framework to achieve target 11.a, and more generally can be instrumental in creating the necessary enabling 
framework to implement the urban development objectives of SDG 11. For instance, the NUA explicitly 
identifies NUPs as essential to achieve the urban paradigm shift it advocates for, recognizing the leading role of 
national governments […] in the implementation of inclusive and effective urban policies and legislation for 
sustainable urban development (NUA – 15.b). Moreover, the Urban-Rural Linkages Guiding Principles provide 
practical approach and actions to enhance territorial cohesion including via policies4. OECD set of urban and 
rural policies are additional frameworks that are very important to enhance social, economic an economic links 
across urban-rural and peri-urban territories5.  
 
Finally, NUPs can also be an instrument to coordinate the urban components of NDCs across scales and sectors 
and mainstream the principles of climate change adaptation and mitigation for the implementation of the 
Paris Agreement6.  
 
Qualifiers for a measurable process indicator  
Given their instrumental role for the implementation and monitoring of global urban agendas, the adoption of 
a NUP by a national government can be considered as a strong indicator of political commitment to promoting 
sustainable urban development. It also makes them particularly well suited for measuring target 11.a through 
a process indicator. As a process indicator, 11.a.1 is indeed supposed to assess the progress made towards 
creating an enabling environment that will ensure achievement of the outcomes and impacts of the targets of 
the Sustainable Development Agenda. Its definition sets the foundation on how target 11.a can be achieved, 
through measurable means. The proposed revision of the indicator therefore supplements national urban 
policies and regional development plans with 3 qualifiers that indicate the means of successfully reaching the 
requirements of target 11.a.  
 
The first qualifier is that policies and plans should respond to population dynamics. Grounding policies and 
plans in the most current and comprehensive spatial and demographic data and projections is indeed a 
prerequisite for a successful implementation. The challenges posed by rapid urbanization indeed stem from 
the fact that policy and planning framework and their implementation are outpaced by population growth, 
coupled with policy priorities that may not prioritize inclusive development for all current and future urban 
residents, which together result in straining the provision of infrastructure and services, and causing socio-
economic and environmental damages. Forecasting demographic trends and needs in the diagnosis phase of 
policies and plans enables governments to plan ahead for urbanization and provide adequate land and 
infrastructure in a more cost-efficient and less socially disruptive way than trying to catch up, repair and 
upgrade uncontrolled expansion. This process of developing urban policies and plans can also be the occasion 
to improve national data collection on urban areas, and serve other SDG-11 indicators, as well as provide a 
baseline for monitoring the outcomes of such interventions.  
 
The second qualifier requires policies and plans to ensure balanced territorial development, in a direct answer 
to target 11.a.1’s reference to the urban, peri-urban and rural continuum. Policies and plans should adopt a 
broad territorial perspective and consider the linkages and flows from urban to rural areas not only to avoid 
and reduce social, economic and environmental disparities between territories but also to promote distinctive 
strengths and encourage beneficial interactions for the most efficient path to sustainable growth for the 
country. Such a perspective for policies and plans is achieved higher territorial scale than cities, through 
regional plans and national policies.  
 
Finally, the third qualifier is to increase local fiscal space. As integrated NUPs and regional development plans 
introduce a more coordinated and decentralized articulation of responsibilities for urban development,

ensuring that subnational and local governments have the adequate financial resources to carry out their 
responsibilities is essential to the successful implementation of policies and plans. The transfer of 
competences from central to local levels must therefore be accompanied by a commensurate devolution of 
financial resources and autonomy. Moreover, in times of shrinking governmental budgets, the capacity of local 
governments to expand and diversify endogenous financial resources and revenues and not rely too heavily on 
central transfers should be increased. This involves more fiscal power and capacity, better land value capture 
mechanisms – which go hand in hand with a clear and enforceable land policy framework – and innovative 
financial partnerships, for instance collaborating with the private sector for service and infrastructure delivery. 
In all cases, fiscal policies and mechanisms must remain subordinated to the established urban policy and 
planning objectives: central transfers must be embedded within the NUP framework, and take into account 
territorial equity; and local fiscal systems must be closely tied to local territorial plans so as to incentivize 
sustainable patterns of development.

policy cycle of binding and non-binding policy instruments aimed at supporting Sustainable Consumption 
and Production.  
• 
Sustainable Consumption and Production: the working definition of Sustainable Consumption and 
Production (SCP) used in the context of this framework is: “The use of services and related products, 
which respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while minimising the use of natural 
resources and toxic materials as well as the emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the 
service or product so as not to jeopardise the needs of future generation.”1 
• 
 Policy: although quite flexible and contexts specific, a policy is usually defined as a course of action 
that has been officially agreed by an entity or an organization (governmental or non-governmental) 
and is effectively implemented to achieve specific objectives. 
• 
Policy instruments for sustainable consumption and production: policy instruments refer to the 
means – methodologies, measures or interventions – that are used to achieve those objectives. In 
the case of SCP, such instruments are designed and implemented to reduce the environmental 
impacts of consumption and production patterns, with a view of generating economic and/or social 
benefits.  
 
Making progress along the policy cycle refers to the development, adoption, implementation or evaluation 
of such policy instruments.   
 
Rationale: 
Mainstreaming sustainable consumption and production in decision-making at all levels is a core function 
of the 10-Year Framework, which is expected to “support the integration of sustainable consumption and 
production into sustainable development policies, programmes and strategies, as appropriate, including, 
where applicable, into poverty reduction strategies” (Rio+20 Outcome Document – A/CONF.216/5). The 
purpose of this indicator is to help assess the volume and geographical repartition of governments 
progressing on sustainable consumption and production. In addition, further information is being collected 
on the types, focus and orientation of the policy instruments that are being developed and used, to monitor

their progression over time as well as their contribution to other Sustainable Development Goals. This 
should support evaluation of how much / how fast governments progress in the development and 
application of policies addressing sustainable consumption and production, whether at cross-cutting or 
sectoral level. 
 
The indicator is also considering both binding (laws and regulations) and non-binding policy instruments. 
The first category is essential to the shift, as binding instruments provide the legal ground for sustainable 
consumption and production, and can be used for enforcement or to provide incentives. The ability to 
develop, pass and implement legislation is an indication of jurisdictions’ engagement in the shift towards 
sustainable consumption and production. This indicator can also help monitor the evolution of the global 
legislative landscape. The second category is also essential to ensure institutional engagement, 
commitment and ownership. In some cases, non-binding policy instruments can lead to the creation of 
new legal ones. The development and implementation of non-binding instruments across sectors also 
provides information on engagement of partners and other stakeholders in sustainable consumption and 
production.

assessment), a number of criteria are measured, which are then combined to give a single score between 
zero and one for each component. (See methodology section for full details.) 
 
The indicator and its methodology have been reviewed and endorsed by UNESCO’s Technical Cooperation 
Group on the Indicators for SDG 4-Education 2030 (TCG), which is responsible for the development and 
maintenance of the thematic indicator framework for the follow-up and review of SDG 4. The TCG also has 
an interest in education-related indicators in other SDGs, including global indicators 12.8.1 and 13.3.1. The 
TCG is composed of 38 regionally representative experts from UNESCO Member States (nominated by the 
respective geographic groups of UNESCO), as well as international partners, civil society, and the Co-Chair 
of the Education 2030 Steering Committee. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics acts as the Secretariat.

12.c.1,Goal 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"12.c Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities",12.c.1 Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies (production and consumption) per unit of GDP,SDG-indicator-pdfs/Metadata-12-0c-01.pdf,"In order to measure fossil fuel subsidies at the national, regional and global level, three sub-indicators are 
recommended for reporting on this indicator: 1) direct transfer of government funds; 2) induced transfers 
(price support); and as an optional sub-indicator 3) tax expenditure, other revenue foregone, and under-
pricing of goods and services. The definitions of the IEA Statistical Manual (IEA, 2005) and the Agreement 
on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) (WTO, 
1994) are used to define fossil fuel subsidies. Standardised descriptions from the United Nations 
Statistical Office’s Central Product Classification should be used to classify individual energy products. It is 
proposed to drop the wording “as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels” and thus this 
indicator is effectively ""Amount of fossil fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption)"". 
  
Rationale: 
The scale and impact of fossil fuel subsidies presents both challenges and opportunities for achieving the 
goals of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development. For one, the use of fossil fuels, and their 
promotion through subsidy schemes, adversely affects the ability of governments to attain key goals, 
such as reducing poverty, improving health, reaching gender equality, providing access to energy, and 
addressing climate change. At the same time, there is a need to ensure that poor households that are 
particularly vulnerable to price increases obtain or retain access to energy. Energy-dependent sectors of 
the economy can be affected, particularly by abrupt changes in prices. Any successful reform therefore 
requires careful analysis and adapted mitigation measures. For another, reallocating fossil fuel subsidies 
to sectors that are relevant for development could give a boost to reaching the SDGs.  
 
Awareness and understanding of existing subsidies based on credible data is necessary to increase 
transparency and inform decision-making. Reporting against a global indicator measuring consumer and 
producer fossil fuel subsidies provides a global picture that encompasses both consumer and producer 
subsidies. It allows for tracking of national and global trends and serve as an important guide for policy-
making.

sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock whose abundance is 
at or greater than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as 
biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered 
biologically unsustainable.  
 
Last updated: February 2021 
MSY is defined as the greatest amount of catch that can be harvested continuously from a stock under 
constant and current environmental conditions (e.g., habitat, water conditions, species composition and 
interactions, and anything that could affect birth, growth, or death rates of the stock) without affecting 
the long-term productivity of the stock. The indicator measures the sustainability of fish resources based 
a good balance between human use and ecological conservation. 
 
MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points used in fisheries 
management today. This is primarily because, for decades, reference points from surplus production 
models have most often been set based on the concept of MSY and they are the basic benchmarks for 
the sustainability of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3)).

forests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-
indicator provides further qualification to the management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are 
independently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards.  
 
The sub-indicators are:  
1. Annual forest area change rate  
2. Above-ground biomass stock in forest  
3. Proportion of forest area located within legally established protect areas  
4. Proportion of forest area under a long-term forest management plan

The share of all trade in wildlife detected as being illegal 
 
Rationale: 
 
There are over 35,000 species under international protection, so it is impossible to monitor all poaching. 
Illegal trade, however, is an indirect indicator of poaching. Wildlife seizures represent concrete instances 
of illegal trade, but the share of overall wildlife crime they represent is unknown and variable. In addition, 
the number of species under international protection continues to grow. Legal international trade in 
protected species, by definition, is 100% captured in the CITES Trade Database, which now contains over 
16 million records of trade in CITES-listed species. To ground the illegal trade data in a complete 
indicator, the ratio of aggregated seizures to total trade is estimated. An increase in the share of total 
wildlife trade that is illegal would be interpreted as a negative indicator, and a decrease as a positive one. 
 
Because the illegal wildlife trade represents thousands of distinct products, a means of aggregation is 
necessary. The legal trade value does not represent the true black market value of the items seized, nor 
the true value of the legal shipments, because it is derived from a single market source (US LEMIS). It 
does, however, present a logical and consistent means of aggregating unlike products.

The indicator is defined as the total count of victims of intentional homicide divided by the total 
population, expressed per 100,000 population. 
 
Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause 
death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015); 
population refers to total resident population in a given country in a given year. 
 
Rationale: 
 
This indicator is widely used at national and international level to measure the most extreme form of 
violent crime and it also provides a direct indication of lack of security. Security from violence is a pre-
requisite for individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to develop freely. 
Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and this indicator has a global applicability. 
 
Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences 
and, in the longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. If data are properly disaggregated (as 
suggested in the ICCS), the indicator can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide: 
inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime (including organized crime and other 
forms of criminal activities) and socio-political (including terrorism, hate crime). 
 
"
16.1.2,"Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels",16.1 Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere,"16.1.2 Conflict-related deaths per 100,000 population, by sex, age and cause",SDG-indicator-pdfs/Metadata-16-01-02.pdf,"This indicator is defined as the total count of conflict-related deaths divided by the total population, 
expressed per 100,000 population. 
 
‘Conflict’ is defined as ‘armed conflict’ in reference to a terminology enshrined in International 
Humanitarian Law (IHL), and applied to situations based on the assessment of the United Nations (UN) and 
other internationally mandated entities.  ‘Conflict-related deaths’ refers to direct and indirect deaths 
associated to armed conflict.  ‘Population’ refers to total resident population in a given situation of armed 
conflict included in the indicator, in a given year. Population data are derived from annual estimates 
produced by the UN Population Division. 
 
 Rationale: 
This indicator measures the prevalence of armed conflicts and their impact in terms of loss of life.  Together 
with the indicator 16.1.1 on intentional homicide, they measure violent deaths that occur in all countries 
of the world (intentional homicides) and in situations of armed conflict (conflict-related deaths).  
 
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development seeks to strengthen universal peace and commits to 
redouble efforts to resolve or prevent conflict. It recognizes that there can be no sustainable development 
without peace and no peace without sustainable development.  Counting deaths occurring in situations of 
armed conflict is therefore essential to the measurement of the Agenda, including and beyond its Goal 16. 
Monitoring conflict-related deaths is also necessary to help protect civilians and other potential victims, 
ensure respect of humanitarian and human rights standards, and understand the patterns and 
consequences of armed conflicts in order to prevent future armed conflicts.

The total number of persons who have been victim of physical, psychological or sexual violence in the 
previous 12 months, as a share of the total population. 
 
Rationale: 
 
This indicator measures the prevalence of victimization from physical, sexual (and, possibly, 
psychological) violence. It is globally relevant as violence in various forms occurs in all regions and 
countries of the world. Given that acts of violence are heavily underreported to the authorities, this 
indicator needs to be based on data collected through sample surveys of the adult population.

This indicator refers to the proportion of the population (adults) who feel safe walking alone in their 
neighbourhood. 
 
Rationale: 
 
The concept of ‘fear of crime’ has been used in dozens of crime victimization surveys and the standard 
formulation used here has been seen as effective in different cultural contexts. It is important to 
understand that ‘fear of crime’ is a phenomenon that is separate from the prevalence of crime and that 
may be even largely independent from actual experience, as the perception of crime and the resulting 
fear of it is mediated by a number of factors, such as the awareness of crime, the public discussion and 
the media and personal circumstances. Nevertheless, the ‘fear of crime’ is an important indicator in itself 
as a high level of fear can negatively influence well-being and lead to reduced contacts with the public, 
reduced trust and activities and thus an obstacle to development.

The indicator is defined as the ratio between the total number of victims of trafficking in persons 
detected or living in a country and the population resident in the country, expressed per 100,000 
populations. 
 
According to Article 3, paragraph (a) of the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol, trafficking in persons is 
defined as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the 
threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of 
power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the 
consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation 
shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual 
exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of 
organs”. 
 
Article 3, (b) states “the consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth 
in subparagraph (a) of this article shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) 
have been used”; 
 
Article 3, (c) states “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child for the 
purpose of exploitation shall be considered trafficking in persons even if this does not involve any of the 
means set forth in subparagraph (a);"" 
 
Rationale: 
 
The rationale is measuring the prevalence of the number of victims of trafficking according to the victims 
profile and the forms of exploitation.

Number of victims of violent crime in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to 
competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms, as a percentage of all 
victims of violent crime in the previous 12 months 
 
Rationale: 
 
Reporting to competent authorities is the first step for crime victims to seek justice: if competent 
authorities are not alerted they are not in a condition to conduct proper investigations and administer 
justice. However, lack of trust and confidence in the ability of the police or other authorities to provide 
effective redress, or objective and subjective difficulties in accessing them, can influence negatively the 
reporting behaviour of crime victims. As such, reporting rates provide a direct measure of the confidence 
of victims of crime in the ability of the police or other authorities to provide assistance and bring 
perpetrators to justice. Reporting rates provide also a measure of the ‘dark figure’ of crime, that is the 
proportion of crimes not reported to the police. Trends in reporting rates of violent crime can be used to 
monitor public trust and confidence in competent authorities on the basis of actual behaviours and not 
perceptions.

The total number of persons held in detention who have not yet been sentenced, as a percentage of the 
total number of persons held in detention, on a specified date. 
 
Rationale: 
 
The indicator signifies overall respect for the principle that persons awaiting trial shall not be detained in 
custody unnecessarily. This, in turn, is premised on aspects of the right to be presumed innocent until 
proven guilty. From a development perspective, extensive use of pre-sentence detention when not 
necessary for reasons such as the prevention of absconding, the protection of victims or witnesses, or the 
prevention of the commission of further offences, can divert criminal justice system resources, and exert 
financial and unemployment burdens on the accused and his or her family. Measuring the relative extent 
to which pre-sentence detention is used can provide the evidence to assist countries in lowering such 
burdens and ensuring its proportionate use.

States dollars. IFFs are defined as “financial flows that are illicit in origin, transfer or use, that reflect an 
exchange of value and that cross country borders”. 
 
 
Rationale: 
A major challenge to sustainable development of societies around the world, particularly in developing 
countries, is represented by several criminal activities and tax-related illicit practices which are at the 
origin or associated with IFFs. Proceeds from criminal activities are often transferred between countries 
to be laundered, utilized and reinvested in licit or illicit activities. These flows drain resources from 
sustainable development. Combatting IFFs is therefore a crucial component of the goal to promote 
peace, justice and strong institutions, as set out in Goal 16 of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development.

established by a competent authority in line with international instruments 
 
Rationale: 
While Target 16.4 aims at significantly reducing illicit arms flows, directly measuring these types of flows 
is extremely difficult due to the underground nature of illicit arms trafficking. Therefore, the indicator 
does not aim at measuring these flows, but the efficiency with which the international community 
combats the phenomenon of illicit arms trafficking.

This indicator is defined as the percentage of persons who paid at least one bribe (gave a public official 
money, a gift or counter favour) to a public official, or were asked for a bribe by these public officials, in 
the last 12 months, as a percentage of persons who had at least one contact with a public official in the 
same period. 
 
Rationale: 
 
Corruption is an antonym of equal accessibility to public services and of correct functioning of the 
economy; as such, it has a negative impact on fair distribution of resources and development 
opportunities. Besides, corruption erodes public trust in authorities and the rule of law; when 
administrative bribery becomes a recurrent experience of large sectors of the population and businesses, 
its negative effects have an enduring negative impact on the rule of law, democratic processes and 
justice. By providing a direct measure of the experience of bribery, this indicator provides an objective 
metric of corruption, a yardstick to monitor progress in the fight against corruption

Proportion of firms asked for a gift or informal payment when meeting with tax officials.  
 
In every Enterprise Survey (www.enterprisesurveys.org), there is a standard question which asks the 
survey respondent if they were inspected by or required to meet with tax officials. If the respondent 
indicates ‘yes’, then there is a follow-up question which asks if the respondent was expected to provide a 
gift or an informal payment during these inspections/meetings. The response options include “yes”, “no”, 
“don’t know”, and “refuse”. 
 
Enterprise Surveys are firm-level surveys conducted in World Bank client countries. The survey focuses on 
various aspects of the business environment as well as firm’s outcome measures such as annual sales, 
productivity, etc. The surveys are conducted via face-to-face interviews with the top manager or business 
owner. For each country, the survey is conducted approximately every 4-5 years. 
 
Rationale: 
 
The rationale for this indicator is to ascertain whether firms are solicited for gifts or informal payments 
(i.e. bribes) when meeting with tax officials. Paying taxes are required of formal forms in most countries 
and hence the rational for this indicator is to measure the incidence of corruption during this routine 
interaction. The key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain 
to the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; this question regarding corruption during tax 
inspections/meetings is not an opinion-based question but rather a question grounded in the firm’s 
reality.

The legislative sub-component of indicator 16.7.1 aims to measure how representative of the general 
population are the individuals occupying key decision-making positions in national legislatures. More 
specifically, this indicator measures the proportional representation of various demographic groups 
(women, age groups) in the national population amongst individuals occupying the following positions in 
national legislatures: (1) Members, (2) Speakers and (3) Chairs of permanent committees in charge of the 
following portfolios: Foreign Affairs, Defence, Finance, Human Rights and Gender Equality. Furthermore, 
it looks at the electoral and constitutional provisions adopted by countries to secure representation in 
national legislatures of persons with disabilities and contextually relevant population groups.

This indicator is defined as the number of verified cases of killing, enforced disappearance, 
torture, arbitrary detention, kidnapping and other harmful acts committed against journalists, 
trade unionists and human rights defenders on an annual basis. 
 
‘Journalists’ refers to everyone who observes, describes, documents and analyses events, 
statements, policies, and any propositionsthat can affect society, with the purpose of systematizing 
such information and gathering of facts and analyses to inform sectors of society or soci ety as a 
whole, and others who share these journalistic functions, including all media workers and support

1 Current approved formulation of the indicator (E/2017/24-E/CN.3/2017/35). Informed by ongoing efforts to 
improve the methodology of the indicator, and consultations with relevant stakeholders, OHCHR, UNESCO and 
ILO have agreed to work towards a refinement of the current formulation to streamline and closelyalign it 
with target 16.10. The working draft of the proposed refinement is as follows: 
“Number of verified cases of killing, enforced disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, kidnapping and other 
harmful acts against journalists, trade unionists and human rights defenders” 
The elements of the proposed refinement serves as the basisfor this metadata and methodological approach. 
Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to 
justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels 
Target 16.10: Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance 
with national legislation and international agreements

others who engage in forms of self-publication in print, on the internet or elsewhere.3 
 
‘Trade unionists’ refers to everyone exercising their right to form and to join trade unions for the 
protection of their interests.4 A trade union is an association of workers organized to protect and 
promote their common interests.5 
 
‘Human rights defenders’ refers to everyone exercising their right, individually and in association 
with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms at national and international levels,6 including some journalists and trade 
unionists. While the term ‘human rights advocate’ is broadly speaking a synonymous of ‘human 
rights defender,’ the latter is preferred as it is more consistent with internationally agreed human 
rights standards and established practice. 
 
The different categories of violations tracked by the indicator have been defined in accordance 
with international law and methodological standards and monitoring practices developed by the 
OHCHR and other international mechanisms and classified drawing on the International 
Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) disseminated by the UN Office of Drugs and 
Crime (UNODC). As such: 
 
• ‘Killing’ is defined as any extrajudicial execution or other unlawful killing by State actors or 
other actors acting with the State’s permission, support or acquiescence that were 
motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a 
journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender; or while the victim was engaged in 
such activities; or by persons or groups not acting with the support or acquiescence of the 
State whose harmful acts were either motivated by the victim engaging in activities as a 
journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, and/or met by a failure of due 
diligence on the part of the State in responding to these harmful acts, such a failu re 
motivated by the victim or associate engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or 
human rights defender; and other unlawful attacks and destruction in violation of 
international humanitarian law leading to or intending to cause the victim’s death., 
corresponding to ICCS codes 0101, 0102 and 110139 and coded herein as A [0101, 0102 
and 110139]. 
 
• `Enforced disappearance’ refers to the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of 
deprivation of liberty of a victim by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons 
acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, motivated by the 
victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade 
unionist or human rights defender, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation

victim outside the protection of the law, corresponding to ICCS code 020222 (forced 
disappearance) and coded herein as B [02022ED] 
 
• ‘Torture’ refers to any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is 
intentionally inflicted on a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, for such 
purposes as obtaining from them or a third person information or a confession, punishing 
them, intimidating them or coercing them, or for any reason based on discrimination of 
any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the 
consent or acquiescence of a public official or other persons acting in an official capacity, 
corresponding to ICCS code 11011 and coded herein as C [11011]. 
 
• ‘Arbitrary detention’ refers to any arrest or detention not in accordance with national 
laws, because it is not properly based on grounds established by law, or does not conform 
to the procedures established by law, or is otherwise deemed arbitrary in the sense of 
being inappropriate, unjust, unreasonable or unnecessary in the circumstances, and 
motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a 
journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS code 020222 
(unlawful deprivation of liberty) and coded herein as D [020222AD] 
 
• ‘Kidnapping’ refers to unlawfully detaining, taking away and/or confining a victim without 
their consent by persons or groups not acting with the support or acquiescence of the 
State, and the unlawful detention and/or confinement was met by a failure of due 
diligence on the part of the State in responding to the unlawful detention, such a failure 
motivated by the victim or associate engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or 
human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS codes 020221 and coded herein as E

State’s permission, support or acquiescence causing harm or intending to cause harm and 
motivated by the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human 
rights defender, corresponding to ICCS codes 0301, 0219, 110133, 02012, 0205, 0208, 
0210 and 0211, and coded herein as F [0301, 0219, 110133, 02012, 0205, 0208, 0210 and 
0211]. 
 
‘Verified cases’ refer to reported cases that contain a minimum set of relevant information on 
particular persons and circumstances, which have been reviewed by mandated bodies, 
mechanisms, and institutions, and provided them with reasonable grounds to believe those 
persons were victims of the above-mentioned human rights violations or abuses. 
 
Rationale: 
 
This indicator seeks to measure enjoyment of fundamental freedoms (e.g. freedom of opinion, 
freedom of expression and access to information, the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of 
association) on the premise that killing, enforced disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, 
kidnapping and other harmful act against journalists, trade unionists and human rights defenders 
have a chilling effect on the exercise of these fundamental freedoms. What distinguishes this

indicator from Indicator 16.1.1 (number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population 
by sex and age) aside from the broader scope of violent incidents, is the motivation or causal 
factor, i.e. that the violation was motivated by the victim having stood up to defend the rights of 
others, exercise fundamental freedoms, or have occurred while the victim was engaged in such 
activities. Alongside indicator 16.10.2 (number of countries that adopt and implement 
constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information) this indicator 
provides both a micro and macro-level snapshot of the state of the aforementioned fundamental 
freedoms in various contexts, as well as a link to the processes and structures required to meet 
human rights obligations with respect to those fundamental freedoms.

global aggregates. 
 
Based on the definition above, the indicator has two components: 
1. 
Adoption 
Last updated: July 2021 
2. 
Implementation 
 
Under each component, key questions were identified based on what can be called “Principles of Access 
to Information”, and which highlight essential components for effective implementation of Access to 
Information implementation at the country level. These Principles are synthesized from existing 
frameworks and documents recognised internationally.1  For the purpose of this survey, the principles of 
relevance are as follows: 
 
1. 
Legal frameworks for Access to Information  
2. 
Limited exemptions 
3. 
Oversight mechanism   
4. 
Appeals mechanism 
5. 
Record keeping and reporting 
 
Each question values between 0 and 2. Upon the completion of the survey, a country can get a total score 
of 0-9.  The total score of each country will not be assigned to any level category (e.g.: low, medium or 
high). However, it will contribute to global aggregates.

This indicator Existence of independent national human rights institutions in compliance with the Paris 
Principles measures the compliance of existing national human rights institutions with the Principles 
relating to the Status of National Institutions (The Paris Principles), which were adopted by the General 
Assembly (resolution 48/134) based on the rules of procedure of the Global Alliance of National Human 
Rights Institutions (GANHRI, formerly the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions 
for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights or ICC). 
 
Rationale: 
 
This indicator measures the global continual efforts of countries in setting up independent national 
institutions, through international cooperation, to promote inclusive, peaceful and accountable societies. 
The creation and fosterage of a NHRI indicates a State’s commitment to promote and protect the human 
rights provided in international human rights instruments. Compliance with the Paris Principles vest 
NHRIs with a broad mandate, competence and power to investigate, report on the national human rights 
situation, and publicize human rights through information and education. While NHRIs are essentially 
state funded, they are to maintain independence and pluralism. When vested with a quasi-judicial 
competence, NHRIs handle complaints and assist victims in taking their cases to courts making them an 
essential component in the national human rights protection system. These fundamental functions that 
NHRIs play and their increasing participation in the international human rights fora make them important 
actors in the improvement of the human rights situation, including the elimination of discriminatory laws 
and the promotion and enforcement of non-discriminatory laws. At the national level reporting, the 
better the accreditation classification of the NHRI reflects that it is credible, legitimate, relevant and 
effective in promoting human rights at the national level.

Revenue is defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) of GFSM 2014 an increase in net worth resulting from a 
transaction. It is a fiscal indicator for assessing the sustainability of fiscal activities. General government 
units have four types of revenue. The major types of revenue are taxes (GFS code 11), social 
contributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code 13), and other revenue (GFS code 14). Of these, 
compulsory levies and transfers are the main sources of revenue for most general government units. In 
particular, taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable by government units from institutional 
units. Social contributions are actual or imputed revenue receivable by social insurance schemes to make 
provision for social insurance benefits payable. Grants are transfers receivable by government units from 
other resident or nonresident government units or international organizations, and that do not meet the 
definition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution. Other revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes,

The precise definition of the indicator is the Proportion of domestic budgetary central government 
expenditure funded by taxes. Budgetary central government, described in GFSM 2014 (paragraph 2.81) is 
an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, 
particularly the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. The budgetary central 
government is often a single unit of the central government that encompasses the fundamental activities 
of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general government is 
usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government’s revenue (and 
expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by 
means of a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the ministries, departments, agencies, boards, 
commissions, judicial authorities, legislative bodies, and other entities that make up the budgetary 
central government are not separate institutional units. This is because they generally do not have the

partnerships in infrastructure.” 
The indicator by the World Bank Group defines the term Public-Private Partnership (PPPs) as “any 
contractual arrangement between a public entity or authority and a private entity, for providing a public 
asset or service, in which the private party bears significant risk and management responsibility.”  
 
The term infrastructure refers to: 
• 
Energy: electricity generation, transmission, and distribution, and natural gas transmission and 
distribution pipelines 
• 
Information and communications technology (ICT): ICT backbone infrastructure 
• 
Transport: Airports, railways, ports, and roads. 
• 
Water: potable water treatment and distribution, and sewerage collection and treatment. 
 
 
Rationale: 
The infrastructure gaps is significant and it would require to increase private sector financing. The 
rationale behind the indicator is to measure the changes in the volume of public private partnerships in 
infrastructure and assess trends and identify constraints for private sector participation.
