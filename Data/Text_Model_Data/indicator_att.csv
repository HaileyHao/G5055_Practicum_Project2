Effective coverage of social protection is measured by the number of people who are either actively contributing to a social insurance scheme or receiving benefits (contributory or non-contributory)."
1.4.1,1, End poverty in all its forms everywhere,1.4,1.4.1,Proportion of population living in households with access to basic services,"The following key concepts were defined to support the indicator in the context of poverty eradication.
Basic Services refer to public service provision systems that meet human basic needs including drinking
water, sanitation, hygiene, energy, mobility, waste collection, health care, education and information
technologies. The basis cervices indicator will be therefore based on 9 components. These components
are captured in various standalone indicators of the SDGs, which means that the concepts and definitions
of SDG indicator 1.4.1 will be derived from or are the same as those of these specific SDG indicators.
Access to basic services implies that sufficient and affordable service is reliably available with adequate
quality.
1) Access to Basic Drinking Water Services refers to the use of drinking water from an improved
source that is available with a collection time of not more than 30 minutes for a round trip,
including queuing. Improved sources include: piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected
dug wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water. This definition is based on the
JMP drinking water ladder and is the foundation for SDG indicator 6.1.1 - Proportion of
population using safely managed drinking water services.
2) Access to Basic Sanitation Services refers to the use of improved facilities that are not shared
with other households. Improved facilities include: flush/pour flush to piped sewer systems,
septic tanks or pit latrines; ventilated improved pit latrines, composting toilets or pit latrines with
slabs. This definition is based on the JMP sanitation ladder and is the foundation for SDG
indicator 6.2.1 - Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a
hand-washing facility with soap and water.
3) Access to Basic Hygiene Facilities refers to availability of a handwashing facility on premises with
soap and water. Handwashing facilities may be fixed or mobile and include a sink with tap water,
buckets with taps, tippy-taps, and jugs or basins designated for handwashing. Soap includes bar
soap, liquid soap, powder detergent, and soapy water but does not include ash, soil, sand or
other handwashing agents. This definition is based on the JMP hygiene ladder and is the
foundation for SDG indicator 6.2.1 - Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation
services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water.
For many low and middle-income countries, achieving universal access to basic drinking water, sanitation
and hygiene remains a high priority, which will help them achieve access to ‘safely managed services’, the
target for SDGs 6.1 and 6.2. 
4) Access to clean fuels and technology refers to use of fuels and technology that are defined by
the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and
kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household
fuel combustion. This component will be captured through SDG 7.1.2 - Percentage of population
with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology.
5) Access to Basic Mobility refers to having convenient access to transport in a rural context (SDG
9.1.1) or having convenient access to public transport in an urban context (SDG 11.2.1).
• Access to mobility rural context
To eradicate poverty, communities need to be connected to socio-economic opportunities
by roads that are passable all season and attract reliable and affordable public transport
services. In many areas, safe footpaths, footbridges and waterways may be required in
conjunction with, or as an alternative, to roads. For reasons of simplification, specific
emphasis was given to roads in this definition (based on the Rural Access Index - RAI -
percentage of the population <2km from an all-season road (equivalent to a walk of 20-25
mins)1
)
2
since road transport reflects accessibility for the great majority of people in rural
contexts. In those situations where another mode, such as water transport is dominant the
definition will be modified and contextualized to reflect and capture those aspects. Access to
mobility has shown some of the largest impacts on poverty reduction and has a strong
correlation to educational, economic and health outcomes (“transport as an enabler”).
RAI is the most widely accepted metric for tracking access to transport in rural areas and has
been included in the SDGs as SDG indicator 9.1.1 - Proportion of the rural population who live
within 2 km of an all-season road. This component will be therefore captured through SDG
9.1.1.
The existing RAI methodology relies on household level survey data – however, is currently
being revised into a GIS-based index that exploits advances in digital technology with the aim
to create a more accurate and cost-effective tool.
• Access to mobility urban context
The urban context of access to transport is measured utilizing the methodology of SDG
11.2.1 –Proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport by sex,
age and persons with disabilities.
The metadata methodology is available (UN-Habitat being the custodian agency) and uses a
combination of spatial and qualitative analysis. A 500 m buffer around each public transport
stop is used and overlaid with socio-demographic data – in order to identify the population
served. We know that measuring spatial access is not sufficient and does not address the
temporal dimension associated with the availability of public transport. Complementary to
the above, other parameters of tracking the transport target related to street density/ no. of
intersections, affordability, or quality in terms of safety, travel time, universal access, are all
tracked. 
6) Access to Basic Waste Collection Services refers to the access that the population have to a
reliable waste collection service, including both formal municipal and informal sector services.
This is connected to and will be captured through SDG Indicator 11.6.1 - Proportion of municipal
solid waste collected and managed in controlled facilities out of total municipal waste generated,
by cities. A ‘collection service’ may be ‘door to door’ or by deposit into a community container.
‘Collection’ includes collection for recycling as well as for treatment and disposal (so includes e.g.
collection of recyclables by itinerant waste buyers). ‘Reliable’ means regular - frequency will
depend on local conditions and on any pre-separation of the waste. For example, both mixed
waste and organic waste are often collected daily in tropical climates for public health reasons,
and generally at least weekly; source-separated dry recyclables may be collected less frequently.
7) Access to Basic Health Care Services refers to access to services that cover in and out-of-area
emergency services, inpatient hospital and physician care, outpatient medical services,
laboratory and radiology services, and preventive health services. Basic health care services also
extend to access to limited treatment of mental illness and substance abuse in accordance with
minimum standards prescribed by local and national ministries of health. This is connected to
and will be measured through SDG indicator 3.8.1 – Coverage of essential health services.
8) Access to Basic Education refers to access to education services that provides all learners with
capabilities they require to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods,
contribute to peaceful and democratic societies and enhance individual well-being. This is
connected to and will be captured through SDG 4.1.1 - Proportion of children and young people
(a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at
least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex.
9) Access to Basic Information Services refers to having a broadband internet access. Broadband is
defined as technologies that deliver advertised download speeds of at least 256 kbit/s.
Connecting the 50% of the world that is still offline means, in large part, ensuring that everyone,
everywhere is able to access an internet that is affordable. The main types of broadband services
are: 1) Fixed (wired) broadband network, such as DSL, cable modem, high speed leased lines,
fibre to- the-home/building, powerline and other fixed (wired) broadband; 2) Terrestrial fixed
(wireless) broadband network, such as WiMAX, fixed CDMA; 3) Satellite broadband network (via
a satellite connection); 4) Mobile broadband network (at least 3G, e.g. UMTS) via a handset and
5) Mobile broadband network (at least 3G, e.g. UMTS) via a card (e.g. integrated SIM card in a
computer) or USB modem. This is connected to and will be captured through SDG 9.c.1 -
Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology."
1.4.2,1, End poverty in all its forms everywhere,1.4,1.4.2,"Proportion of total adult population with secure tenure rights to land, (a) with legally recognized documentation, and (b) who perceive their rights to land as sec","Indicator 1.4.2 measures the relevant part of Target 1.4 (ensure men and women have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to …, ownership of and control over land and other forms of Last reviewed: August 2021 property, inheritance, natural resources). It measures the results of policies that aim to strengthen tenure security for all, including women and other vulnerable groups. Indicator 1.4.2 covers (a) all types of land use (such as residential, commercial, agricultural, forestry, grazing, wetlands based on standard land-use classification) in both rural and urban areas; and (b) all land tenure types as recognized at the country level, such as freehold, leasehold, public land, customary land. An individual can hold land in his/her own name, jointly with other individuals, as a member of a household, or collectively as member of group1, cooperative or other type of association. Secure tenure rights: comprised of two sub-components: (i) legally recognized documentation and (ii) perception of the security of tenure, which are both necessary to provide a full measurement of tenure security. Legally recognized documentation: Legal documentation of rights refers to the recording and publication of information on the nature and location of land, rights and right holders in a form that is recognized by government, and is therefore official. For purposes of computing SDG Indicator 1.4.2, the country specific metadata will define what documentation on land rights will be counted as legally recognized (see next section for rationale). Perceived security of tenure: Perception of tenure security refers to an individual’s perception of the likelihood of involuntary loss of land, such as disagreement of the ownership rights over land or ability to use it, regardless of the formal status and can be more optimistic or pessimistic. Although those without land rights’ documentation may frequently be perceived to be under threat, and those with documentation perceived as protected, there may be situations where documented land rights alone are insufficient to guarantee tenure security. Conversely, even without legally recognized documentation, individuals may feel themselves to be protected against eviction or dispossession. Therefore, capturing and analysing these diverse ranges of situations will enable a more comprehensive understanding of land tenure security, based on a country specific context. For purposes of constructing the indicator (see next section for rationale), we define perceptions of tenure to be secure if: (i) The landholder does not report a fear of involuntary loss of the land within the next five years due to, for example, intra-family, community or external threats and (ii) The landholder reports having the right to bequeath the land. Total adult population: A country’s adult population2 is measured by census data or through surveys using an adequate sampling frame. Interpretation: One motivation that makes the indicator actionable is that, in many developing countries, the gap between data on the availability of documentation and on perception of tenure security can be large. For example, tenure may be perceived as secure, even though rights are not formally documented, as in the case of customary systems and trusted local land governance arrangements. Or, the opposite, tenure may be 1 Group rights include shared or collective rights, and examples include the ejido in Mexico, indigenous territories in Honduras, perpetual DUAT for rural communities in Mozambique. Collective rights occur in a situation where holders of rights to land and natural resources are clearly defined as a collective group and have the right to exclude third parties from the enjoyment of those rights. 2 Country specific legal definition of an ‘adult’ will be applied. Last reviewed: August 2021 perceived as insecure even when there is a high level of formal documentation of rights. The latter situation can be caused by various factors, including limited trust in land administration services, possible duplicated documents, high cost of having state institutions protecting such rights. Reporting on perceived security will provide important information on people’s satisfaction with the institutional quality of service, transparency, appropriateness, accessibility and affordability of land administration services and justice systems."

disaster risk reduction established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) is developing a set of
indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework. These indicators
will eventually reflect the agreements on the Sendai Framework indicators."
1.5.4,1, End poverty in all its forms everywhere,1.5,1.5.4,Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies,"The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in
March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. One of the targets is: “Substantially increase the
number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020”.
In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction
strategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all
sectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should
be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening
of economic, social, health and environmental resilience."
1.a.1,1, End poverty in all its forms everywhere,1.a,1.a.1,Total official development assistance grants from all donors that focus on poverty reduction as a share of the recipient country’s gross national income,"Total official development assistance (ODA) grants from all donors that focus on poverty reduction as a share of the recipient country’s gross national income. The OECD/Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as “flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). Poverty reduction items can be defined as ODA to basic social services (basic health, basic education, basic water and sanitation, population programmes and reproductive health) and developmental food aid (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm). Rationale: Total ODA flows to developing countries quantify the public effort (excluding non- concessional flows and export credits), that all donors provide for the economic development and welfare of developing countries. Within ODA, basic social services and development food aid focus on poverty alleviation in developing countries."
1.a.2,1, End poverty in all its forms everywhere,1.a,1.a.2,"Proportion of total government spending on essential services (education, health and social protection)","Total general (local, regional and central) government expenditure on education (current, capital, and transfers), expressed as a percentage of total general government expenditure on all sectors (including health, education, social services, etc.). It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to the government."
1.b.1,1, End poverty in all its forms everywhere,1.b,1.b.1,Pro-poor public social spending,"Proportion of government spending towards health and education and direct transfers which benefit directly the monetary poor. Government spending measures public expenditures on health and education services. Direct transfers refer to cash transfers and near-cash transfers. The definition of the monetary poor follows national standards, with poverty levels determined by national definition of income or consumption poverty (consistent with SDG 1.2.1). Rationale: The indicator measures the extent to which public spending in three key areas which are critical for poverty eradication, including health, education, and other direct transfers is directly allocated to individuals or households in the monetary poor as per the national definition. The indicator measures if public spending is targeting the monetary poor. Pro-poor social spending is defined if the proportion of government expenditures on social services is higher than the proportion of the population, measured at the level determined by national definition of income/consumption poverty (consistent with SDG 1.2.1). For instance, if the proportion of public spending received by the poor exceeds (falls below) the proportion of poor as defined by national definitions, public expenditures can be interpreted as pro-poor (not pro-poor). This is a strong measurement of the financial commitment governments make to target their services and transfers on the poor groups of society, reinforcing pro-poor development strategies. Further developments of the methodology and improvements in data availability may allow to expand this indicator to other vulnerable groups, such as women and children."
2.1.1,2," End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture",2.1,2.1.1,Prevalence of undernourishment,The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) (French: pourcentage de sous-alimentation; Spanish: porcentaje de sub-alimentación; Italian: prevalenza di sotto-alimentazione) is an estimate of the proportion of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and healthy life.

This transaction cost should be intended as “Global average total cost of sending $200 (or equivalent in local sending currency) and expressed as % of amount sent”. This indicator is readily available and published on a quarterly basis by the World Bank in the Remittance Prices Worldwide database, which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending to 105 receiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where cost is 5% or higher. This should be intended in the sense that it should be possible for remittance senders to send money to the beneficiary for an average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should suffice that in each corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a defined set of service requirements (including service quality, reach etc.), for which the average is 5% or less.

11.3.1,11," Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable",11.3,11.3.1,Ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate,"The indicator is defined as the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate. This indicator requires defining the two components of population growth and land consumption rate. Computing the population growth rate is more straightforward and more readily available, while land consumption rate is slightly challenging, and requires the use of new techniques. In estimating the land consumption rate, one needs to define what constitutes “consumption” of land since this may cover aspects of “consumed” or “preserved” or available for “development” for cases such as land occupied by \nwetlands. Secondly, there is not one unequivocal measure of whether land that is being developed is truly “newly-developed” (or vacant) land, or if it is at least partially “redeveloped”. As a result, the percentage of current total urban land that was newly developed (consumed) will be used as a measure of the land consumption rate. The fully developed area is also sometimes referred to as built up area. "
11.3.2,11," Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable",11.3,11.3.2,Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically,"Civil society organizations (CSOs) make a difference in international development. They provide development services and humanitarian relief, innovate in service delivery, build local capacity and advocate with and for the poor. Acting alone, however, their impact is limited in scope, scale and sustainability. CSOs need to engage in government policy processes more effectively. The development of sustainable human settlements calls for the active engagement of all key stakeholders with particular attention to project/programme beneficiaries and vulnerable groups. Therefore local and national governments should strive to: a) facilitate and protect people’s participation and civic engagement through independent civil society organizations that can be from diverse backgrounds - local, national, and international; b) promote civic and human rights education and training programmes to make urban residents aware of their rights and the changing roles of diverse women, men, and young women and men in urban settings; c) remove the barriers that block participation of socially marginalized groups and promote non-discrimination and the full and equal participation of women, young men and women and marginalized groups. To monitor this indicator fully, it is important to define cities as unique entities and define what constitutes direct participation structures of civil society. Urban planning and management are more clear concepts that UN-Habitat has worked on developing for the last few decades and these are well articulated in the urban agenda documents. Experts who have worked on the methodological developments of this indicator have there put forth the below definitions to help guide the work on this indicator. Rationale: This indicator measures the progress and willingness of elected officials, urban managers and planners to integrate resident and civil society participation in urban planning and management at various levels. Local authorities and governments, along with the international community, are increasingly recognizing the value of civil society and residents’ participation in strengthening the urban development processes. This people-centered approach is key in guiding urban development processes for local ownership, and the implementation of community projects at citywide or local levels. Civil society and public participation fosters a positive relationship between government and the public by communicating effectively and solving the conflicts in a cooperative manner. In many cases when urban planning decisions are made without consultation, the desired results are not achieved and there is a negative impact on society, due to inefficient allocation and use of resources. Ensuring that wide Last updated: November 2018 varieties of opinions are considered assists the decision makers with understanding the interlinkages and nature of problems and potential solutions facing different urban settings. Urban development is a reflection of ideology and national institutions. Public participation means a broader consensus is built and this greatly enhances political interaction between citizens and government, and enhances the legitimacy of the planning process and the plan itself. A plan is more effective if a broad coalition supports the proposal and works together to deliver it. Civil society and public participation in urban management and governance also shows respect to participants’ opinion, needs, aspirations and assets. It can boost their enthusiasm for citizenship and politics, and strengthens their influence in urban planning and public life. When conflicting claims and views are considered, there is a much higher possibility that public trust and buy-in increases in the outcome. This has broader implications for building an active, inclusive and equitable society and more inclusive and sustainable urban environments."

11.6.1,11," Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable",11.6,11.6.1,"Proportion of municipal solid waste collected and managed in controlled facilities out of total municipal waste generated, by cities","SDG 11.6 targets an improved environmental performance of cities and SDG indicator 11.6.1 measures the progress of the performance of a city’s municipal solid waste management. It quantifies the parameters listed below, which are essential for planning and implementing sustainable Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). In most cases, these variables are generally compatible with those collected through the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics (waste section). a) Total MSW generated in the city (tonnes/day) b) Total MSW collected in the city (tonnes/day) c) Proportion of population with access to basic MSW collection services in the city (%) d) Total MSW managed in controlled facilities in the city (tonnes/day) e) MSW composition It is important to realize that part (b) total MSW collected and (c) proportion of the population with access to basic MSW collection services are two different concepts. While part (b) refers to amounts of waste reaching waste management facilities, part (c) considers the population who receive waste collection services. In some cities it is common to dump waste ‘collected’ from households into the surrounding areas instead of transporting it to a disposal or recovery facility. In this case the household has waste collection services, but the collected waste is polluting the environment. Therefore, it is possible that a city has a high proportion of population with access to basic waste collection services, but the amount of MSW collected and transported to waste management facilities is low. Although part (c) is covered by SDG 1 (“End poverty in all its forms everywhere”), under target 1.4 and SDG indicator 1.4.1 which focuses on universal access to basic services, with a particular emphasis on poor and vulnerable groups, this document provides guidelines, quality ladders and household questionnaires to measure the proportion of the population with access to ‘basic’ MSW collection services. The household questionnaire can be integrated into the national census or global household survey mechanism such as Demographic and Health Survey or UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Due to the lack of standardized concepts and definitions that differentiate these two concepts, many cities report the proportion of collected MSW in their own terms. Therefore, this metadata distinguishes clearly between part (b) and (c) and offers introduction to the approaches to monitor and report on part (c). "

These \ninclude; built-up area, cities, open spaces for public use, etc. As a custodian agency, UN-Habitat has worked on these concepts along with several other partners. a) City: A range of accepted definitions of the “city” exist, from those based on population data and extent of the built-up area to those that are based solely on administrative \nboundaries. These definitions vary within and between nations, complicating the task \nof international reporting for the SDGs. Definitions of cities, metropolitan areas and urban agglomerations also vary depending on legal, administrative, political, economic \nLast updated: March 2021 or cultural criteria in the respective countries and regions. Since 2016UN-Habitat and \npartners organized global consultations and discussions to narrow down the set of meaningful definitions that would be helpful for the global monitoring and reporting \nprocess. Following consultations with 86 member states, the United Nations Statistical \nCommission, in its 51st Session (March 2020) endorsed the Degree of Urbanisation \n(DEGURBA) as a workable method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for \ninternational statistical comparisons. 1 This definition combines population size and \npopulation density thresholds to classify the entire territory of a country along the \nurban-rural continuum, and captures the full extent of a city, including the dense \nneighbourhoods beyond the boundary of the central municipality. DEGURBA is applied \nin a two-step process: First, 1 km2 grid cells are classified based on population density, \ncontiguity and population size. Subsequently, local units are classified as urban or rural \nbased on the type of grid cells in which majority of their population resides. For the \ncomputation of indicator 11.7.1, countries are encouraged to adopt the degree of \nurbanisation to define the analysis area (city or urban area). \nb) Built-up area of cities: Conventionally, built up areas of cities are areas occupied by \nbuildings and other artificial surfaces. For indicator 11.7.1, built up areas, as the \nindicator denominator has the same meaning as “city” (see definition of city above).  \n \nPublic space: The Global Public Space toolkit defines Public Space as all places that \nare publicly owned or of public use, accessible and enjoyable by all, for free and \nwithout a profit motive, categorized into streets, open spaces and public facilities. \nPublic space in general is defined as the meeting or gathering places that exist \noutside the home and workplace that are generally accessible by members of the \npublic, and which foster resident interaction and opportunities for contact and \nproximity. This definition implies a higher level of community interaction and places \na focus on public involvement rather than public ownership or stewardship. For the \npurpose of monitoring and reporting on indicator 11.7.1, public space is defined as \nall places of public use, accessible by all, and comprises open public space and \nstreets.  \nc) Open public space: is any open piece of land that is undeveloped or land with no \nbuildings (or other built structures) that is accessible to the public without charge, and \nprovides recreational areas for residents and helps to enhance the beauty and \nenvironmental quality of neighbourhoods.  UN-Habitat recognizes that different cities \nhave different types of open public spaces, which vary in both size and typology. Based \non the size of both soft and hard surfaces, open public spaces are broadly classified into \nsix categories: national/metropolitan open spaces, regional/larger city open spaces, \ndistrict/city open spaces, neighbourhood open spaces, local/pocket open spaces and \nlinear open spaces.  Classification of open public space by typology is described by the \nfunction of the space and can include: green public areas, riparian reserves, parks and \nurban forests, playground, square, plazas, waterfronts, sports field, community \ngardens, parklets and pocket parks.  \n                                                           \n1 A recommendation on the method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for international statistical \ncomparisons. https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3j-Recommendation-\nE.pdf  \nLast updated: March 2021 \nd) Potential open public space:  the identification of open public spaces across cities can \nbe implemented through, among other sources, analysis of high to very high resolution \nsatellite imagery, from base-maps provided by different organizations (eg \nOpenStreetMap, Esri, etc) or as crowd-sourced and volunteered data. While these \nsources provide important baseline data for indicator 11.7.1, some of the identifiable \nspaces may not meet the criteria of being “accessible to the public without charge”. \nThe term “potential open public space” is thus used to refer to open public spaces \nwhich are extracted from the above-mentioned sources (based on their spatial \ncharacter), but which are not yet validated to confirm if they are accessible to the \npublic without charge.   \ne) Streets are defined thoroughfares that are based inside urban areas, towns, cities and \nneighbourhoods most commonly lined with houses or buildings used by pedestrians or \nvehicles in order to go from one place to another in the city, interact and to earn a \nlivelihood. The main purpose of a street is facilitating movement and enabling public \ninteraction. The following elements are considered as streets space: Streets, avenues \nand boulevards, pavements, passages and galleries, Bicycle paths, sidewalks, traffic \nisland, tramways and roundabouts. Elements excluded from street space include plots \n(either built-up), open space blocks, railways, paved space within parking lots and \nairports and individual industries. \nf) \nLand allocated to streets refers to the total area of the city/urban area  that is occupied \nby all forms of streets (as defined above).

This standard definition is extended and adapted to country contexts and may include, where applicable terms such as National Urban Plan, Framework, or Strategy as long as they are aligned with the above qualifiers. Similarly, regional development plans follow the same definition, only applied at the subnational level. NUP that responds to population dynamics: This first qualifier examines to what extent the NUP addresses issues to do with population composition, trends and projections in achieving development goals and targets. - Population composition includes size, geographic distribution and density, household size and composition, mobility and migration, age and sex distribution and disaggregation, as specified in SDG target 17.18 - Trends are changes in composition of the population from over time - Projections are expected changes over time that the NUP needs to ensure that they are well addressed. Key questions for the assessment: - To what extent are quality and timely data on urban and rural population composition, trends and projections available for use in the development, implementation and monitoring of NUP or Regional Development Plans (RDPs)? - To what extent do the strategies/interventions of the NUP and/or RDPs refer to population composition, trends and projections over the timeframe of the plan? Ensure balanced territorial development: This second qualifier entails the promotion of a spatially coherent territory that includes a balanced system of human settlements including cities and towns and including urban corridors; that addresses social, economic, environmental and spatial disparities particularly considering the urban-rural continuum. Key questions for the assessment: To what extent does the national urban policy consider the need for balanced development of the territory as a whole including the differentiated yet equivalent development of all types of settlements including villages, cities and towns, including urban corridors? - To what extent are the linkages – social, economic, environmental and spatial – between urban, peri-urban and rural areas consider with the ultimate goal of strengthening the urban-rural continuum? Increase local fiscal space: Local fiscal space is understood as the sum of financial resources available for improved delivery of basic social and economic services at the local level as a result of the budget and related decisions by governments at all levels without any prejudice to the sustainability of a government’s financial position. Key questions for the assessment: - To what extent has the policy made allowance for the provision of local financial resources to provide for the implementation of the policy and for the delivery of essential basic social and economic services - To what extent has the policy assessed the status of human capacities required to effectively use financial resources for the implementation of the policy and the delivery of essential basic social and economic services? Developing: Developing refers to the policy development pathways and processes that consider the feasibility, diagnosis of policy problems and opportunities, the formulation/drafting of the policy until the approval of the policy Implementing: Implementation refers to the realization of the policy proposal through legislative or financial action/commitments, including the continued monitoring and evaluation of that policy

The definitions of the IEA Statistical Manual (IEA, 2005) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) (WTO, 1994) are used to define fossil fuel subsidies. Standardised descriptions from the United Nations Statistical Office’s Central Product Classification should be used to classify individual energy products. It is proposed to drop the wording “as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels” and thus this indicator is effectively ""Amount of fossil fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption)""."

A fish stock whose abundance is at or greater than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable. Last updated: February 2021 MSY is defined as the greatest amount of catch that can be harvested continuously from a stock under constant and current environmental conditions (e.g., habitat, water conditions, species composition and interactions, and anything that could affect birth, growth, or death rates of the stock) without affecting the long-term productivity of the stock. The indicator measures the sustainability of fish resources based a good balance between human use and ecological conservation. MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points used in fisheries management today. This is primarily because, for decades, reference points from surplus production models have most often been set based on the concept of MSY and they are the basic benchmarks for the sustainability of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3))."

Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) is defined as a state whereby the amount and quality of land
resources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security remain
stable or increase within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems (decision 3/COP12).2
Total land area is the total surface area of a country excluding the area covered by inland waters, like
major rivers and lakes.3
The measurement unit for this indicator is the spatial extent (hectares or km2) expressed as the
proportion (percentage or %) of land that is degraded over total land area.
SDG indicator 15.3.1 is a binary - degraded/not degraded - quantification based on the analysis of
available data for three sub-indicators to be validated and reported by national authorities. The subindicators (Trends in Land Cover, Land Productivity and Carbon Stocks) were adopted by the UNCCD’s
governing body in 2013 as part of its monitoring and evaluation approach.4
The method of computation for this indicator follows the “One Out, All Out” statistical principle and is
based on the baseline assessment and evaluation of change in the sub-indicators to determine the extent
of land that is degraded over total land area.
The One Out, All Out (1OAO)5 principle is applied taking into account changes in the sub-indicators which
are depicted as (i) positive or improving, (ii) negative or declining, or (iii) stable or unchanging. If one of
the sub-indicators is negative (or stable when degraded in the baseline or previous monitoring year) for a
particular land unit, then it would be considered as degraded subject to validation by national authorities."

policy frameworks to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits. It refers to the efforts by countries to
implement the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of
Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (2010) and the
International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (2001).
The Nagoya Protocol covers genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic
resources, as well as the benefits arising from their utilization by setting out core obligations for its
contracting Parties to take measures in relation to access, benefit-sharing and compliance. The
objectives of the International Treaty are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources
for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in
harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity.
The Protocol provides greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic
resources and associated traditional knowledge, and therefore, encourages the advancement of research
on genetic resources which could lead to new discoveries for the benefit of all.
The Nagoya Protocol also creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources, and
thereby enhances the contribution of biodiversity to development and human well-being. In addition,
Parties to the Protocol are to encourage users and providers to direct benefits arising from the utilization
of genetic resources towards the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its
components.
The International Treaty has established the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing, which
facilitates exchanges of plant genetic resources for purposes of agricultural research and breeding, by

While the term ‘human rights advocate’ is broadly speaking a synonymous of ‘human rights defender,’ the latter is preferred as it is more consistent with internationally agreed human rights standards and established practice. The different categories of violations tracked by the indicator have been defined in accordance with international law and methodological standards and monitoring practices developed by the OHCHR and other international mechanisms and classified drawing on the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) disseminated by the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC). As such: • ‘Killing’ is defined as any extrajudicial execution or other unlawful killing by State actors or other actors acting with the State’s permission, support or acquiescence that were motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender; or while the victim was engaged in such activities; or by persons or groups not acting with the support or acquiescence of the State whose harmful acts were either motivated by the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, and/or met by a failure of due diligence on the part of the State in responding to these harmful acts, such a failu re motivated by the victim or associate engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender; and other unlawful attacks and destruction in violation of international humanitarian law leading to or intending to cause the victim’s death., corresponding to ICCS codes 0101, 0102 and 110139 and coded herein as A [0101, 0102 and 110139]. • `Enforced disappearance’ refers to the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty of a victim by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation 2 A/HRC/20/17, para 4 3 Human Rights Committee, General Comment 34, para 44 4UDHR, Art. 23, 4, supplemented by ICESCR, Article 8 5 ILO, Glossary on Labour Law and Industrial Relations (with special reference to the European Union)(Geneva, 2005) p 250 6 Article 1, Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, UNGA Res 53/144, A/RES/53/144 3 Last updated: 08 June 2018 of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the victim, which places the victim outside the protection of the law, corresponding to ICCS code 020222 (forced disappearance) and coded herein as B [02022ED] • ‘Torture’ refers to any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, for such purposes as obtaining from them or a third person information or a confession, punishing them, intimidating them or coercing them, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other persons acting in an official capacity, corresponding to ICCS code 11011 and coded herein as C [11011]. • ‘Arbitrary detention’ refers to any arrest or detention not in accordance with national laws, because it is not properly based on grounds established by law, or does not conform to the procedures established by law, or is otherwise deemed arbitrary in the sense of being inappropriate, unjust, unreasonable or unnecessary in the circumstances, and motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS code 020222 (unlawful deprivation of liberty) and coded herein as D [020222AD] • ‘Kidnapping’ refers to unlawfully detaining, taking away and/or confining a victim without their consent by persons or groups not acting with the support or acquiescence of the State, and the unlawful detention and/or confinement was met by a failure of due diligence on the part of the State in responding to the unlawful detention, such a failure motivated by the victim or associate engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS codes 020221 and coded herein as E [020221] • ‘Other harmful acts’ refers to other acts by State actors or other actors acting with the State’s permission, support or acquiescence causing harm or intending to cause harm and motivated by the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS codes 0301, 0219, 110133, 02012, 0205, 0208, 0210 and 0211, and coded herein as F [0301, 0219, 110133, 02012, 0205, 0208, 0210 and 0211]. ‘Verified cases’ refer to reported cases that contain a minimum set of relevant information on particular persons and circumstances, which have been reviewed by mandated bodies, mechanisms, and institutions, and provided them with reasonable grounds to believe those persons were victims of the above-mentioned human rights violations or abuses. Rationale: This indicator seeks to measure enjoyment of fundamental freedoms (e.g. freedom of opinion, freedom of expression and access to information, the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of association) on the premise that killing, enforced disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, kidnapping and other harmful act against journalists, trade unionists and human rights defenders have a chilling effect on the exercise of these fundamental freedoms. What distinguishes this 4 Last updated: 08 June 2018 indicator from Indicator 16.1.1 (number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population by sex and age) aside from the broader scope of violent incidents, is the motivation or causal factor, i.e. that the violation was motivated by the victim having stood up to defend the rights of others, exercise fundamental freedoms, or have occurred while the victim was engaged in such activities. Alongside indicator 16.10.2 (number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information) this indicator provides both a micro and macro-level snapshot of the state of the aforementioned fundamental freedoms in various contexts, as well as a link to the processes and structures required to meet human rights obligations with respect to those fundamental freedoms."

The major types of revenue are taxes (GFS code 11), social contributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code 13), and other revenue (GFS code 14). Of these, compulsory levies and transfers are the main sources of revenue for most general government units.

The budgetary central government is often a single unit of the central government that encompasses the fundamental activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government’s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature.
