The basis cervices indicator will be therefore based on 9 components. These components\\nare captured in various standalone indicators of the SDGs, which means that the concepts and definitions\\nof SDG indicator 1.4.1 will be derived from or are the same as those of these specific SDG indicators.\\nAccess to basic services implies that sufficient and affordable service is reliably available with adequate\\nquality.\\n1) Access to Basic Drinking Water Services refers to the use of drinking water from an improved\\nsource that is available with a collection time of not more than 30 minutes for a round trip,\\nincluding queuing. Improved sources include: piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected\\ndug wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water. This definition is based on the\\nJMP drinking water ladder and is the foundation for SDG indicator 6.1.1 - Proportion of\\npopulation using safely managed drinking water services.\\n2) Access to Basic Sanitation Services refers to the use of improved facilities that are not shared\\nwith other households. Improved facilities include: flush/pour flush to piped sewer systems,\\nseptic tanks or pit latrines; ventilated improved pit latrines, composting toilets or pit latrines with\\nslabs. This definition is based on the JMP sanitation ladder and is the foundation for SDG\\nindicator 6.2.1 - Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a\\nhand-washing facility with soap and water.\\n3) Access to Basic Hygiene Facilities refers to availability of a handwashing facility on premises with\\nsoap and water. Handwashing facilities may be fixed or mobile and include a sink with tap water,\\nbuckets with taps, tippy-taps, and jugs or basins designated for handwashing. Soap includes bar\\nsoap, liquid soap, powder detergent, and soapy water but does not include ash, soil, sand or\\nother handwashing agents. This definition is based on the JMP hygiene ladder and is the\\nfoundation for SDG indicator 6.2.1 - Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation\\nservices and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water.\\nFor many low and middle-income countries, achieving universal access to basic drinking water, sanitation\\nand hygiene remains a high priority, which will help them achieve access to ‘safely managed services’, the\\ntarget for SDGs 6.1 and 6.2. \\n4) Access to clean fuels and technology refers to use of fuels and technology that are defined by\\nthe emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and\\nkerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household\\nfuel combustion. This component will be captured through SDG 7.1.2 - Percentage of population\\nwith primary reliance on clean fuels and technology.\\n5) Access to Basic Mobility refers to having convenient access to transport in a rural context (SDG\\n9.1.1) or having convenient access to public transport in an urban context (SDG 11.2.1).\\n• Access to mobility rural context\\nTo eradicate poverty, communities need to be connected to socio-economic opportunities\\nby roads that are passable all season and attract reliable and affordable public transport\\nservices. In many areas, safe footpaths, footbridges and waterways may be required in\\nconjunction with, or as an alternative, to roads. For reasons of simplification, specific\\nemphasis was given to roads in this definition (based on the Rural Access Index - RAI -\\npercentage of the population &lt;2km from an all-season road (equivalent to a walk of 20-25\\nmins)1\\n)\\n2\\nsince road transport reflects accessibility for the great majority of people in rural\\ncontexts. In those situations where another mode, such as water transport is dominant the\\ndefinition will be modified and contextualized to reflect and capture those aspects. Access to\\nmobility has shown some of the largest impacts on poverty reduction and has a strong\\ncorrelation to educational, economic and health outcomes (“transport as an enabler”).\\nRAI is the most widely accepted metric for tracking access to transport in rural areas and has\\nbeen included in the SDGs as SDG indicator 9.1.1 - Proportion of the rural population who live\\nwithin 2 km of an all-season road. This component will be therefore captured through SDG\\n9.1.1.\\nThe existing RAI methodology relies on household level survey data – however, is currently\\nbeing revised into a GIS-based index that exploits advances in digital technology with the aim\\nto create a more accurate and cost-effective tool.\\n• Access to mobility urban context\\nThe urban context of access to transport is measured utilizing the methodology of SDG\\n11.2.1 –Proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport by sex,\\nage and persons with disabilities.\\nThe metadata methodology is available (UN-Habitat being the custodian agency) and uses a\\ncombination of spatial and qualitative analysis. A 500 m buffer around each public transport\\nstop is used and overlaid with socio-demographic data – in order to identify the population\\nserved. We know that measuring spatial access is not sufficient and does not address the\\ntemporal dimension associated with the availability of public transport. Complementary to\\nthe above, other parameters of tracking the transport target related to street density/ no. of\\nintersections, affordability, or quality in terms of safety, travel time, universal access, are all\\ntracked. \\n6) Access to Basic Waste Collection Services refers to the access that the population have to a\\nreliable waste collection service, including both formal municipal and informal sector services.\\nThis is connected to and will be captured through SDG Indicator 11.6.1 - Proportion of municipal\\nsolid waste collected and managed in controlled facilities out of total municipal waste generated,\\nby cities. A ‘collection service’ may be ‘door to door’ or by deposit into a community container.\\n‘Collection’ includes collection for recycling as well as for treatment and disposal (so includes e.g.\\ncollection of recyclables by itinerant waste buyers). ‘Reliable’ means regular - frequency will\\ndepend on local conditions and on any pre-separation of the waste. For example, both mixed\\nwaste and organic waste are often collected daily in tropical climates for public health reasons,\\nand generally at least weekly; source-separated dry recyclables may be collected less frequently.\\n7) Access to Basic Health Care Services refers to access to services that cover in and out-of-area\\nemergency services, inpatient hospital and physician care, outpatient medical services,\\nlaboratory and radiology services, and preventive health services. Basic health care services also\\nextend to access to limited treatment of mental illness and substance abuse in accordance with\\nminimum standards prescribed by local and national ministries of health. This is connected to\\nand will be measured through SDG indicator 3.8.1 – Coverage of essential health services.\\n8) Access to Basic Education refers to access to education services that provides all learners with\\ncapabilities they require to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods,\\ncontribute to peaceful and democratic societies and enhance individual well-being. This is\\nconnected to and will be captured through SDG 4.1.1 - Proportion of children and young people\\n(a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at\\nleast a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex.\\n9) Access to Basic Information Services refers to having a broadband internet access. Broadband is\\ndefined as technologies that deliver advertised download speeds of at least 256 kbit/s.\\nConnecting the 50% of the world that is still offline means, in large part, ensuring that everyone,\\neverywhere is able to access an internet that is affordable. The main types of broadband services\\nare: 1) Fixed (wired) broadband network, such as DSL, cable modem, high speed leased lines,\\nfibre to- the-home/building, powerline and other fixed (wired) broadband; 2) Terrestrial fixed\\n(wireless) broadband network, such as WiMAX, fixed CDMA; 3) Satellite broadband network (via\\na satellite connection); 4) Mobile broadband network (at least 3G, e.g. UMTS) via a handset and\\n5) Mobile broadband network (at least 3G, e.g. UMTS) via a card (e.g. integrated SIM card in a\\ncomputer) or USB modem.

It measures the results of policies that aim to strengthen tenure security for all, including women and other vulnerable groups. Indicator 1.4.2 covers (a) all types of land use (such as residential, commercial, agricultural, forestry, grazing, wetlands based on standard land-use classification) in both rural and urban areas; and (b) all land tenure types as recognized at the country level, such as freehold, leasehold, public land, customary land. An individual can hold land in his/her own name, jointly with other individuals, as a member of a household, or collectively as member of group1, cooperative or other type of association. Secure tenure rights: comprised of two sub-components: (i) legally recognized documentation and (ii) perception of the security of tenure, which are both necessary to provide a full measurement of tenure security. Legally recognized documentation: Legal documentation of rights refers to the recording and publication of information on the nature and location of land, rights and right holders in a form that is recognized by government, and is therefore official. For purposes of computing SDG Indicator 1.4.2, the country specific metadata will define what documentation on land rights will be counted as legally recognized (see next section for rationale). Perceived security of tenure: Perception of tenure security refers to an individual’s perception of the likelihood of involuntary loss of land, such as disagreement of the ownership rights over land or ability to use it, regardless of the formal status and can be more optimistic or pessimistic. Although those without land rights’ documentation may frequently be perceived to be under threat, and those with documentation perceived as protected, there may be situations where documented land rights alone are insufficient to guarantee tenure security. Conversely, even without legally recognized documentation, individuals may feel themselves to be protected against eviction or dispossession. Therefore, capturing and analysing these diverse ranges of situations will enable a more comprehensive understanding of land tenure security, based on a country specific context. For purposes of constructing the indicator (see next section for rationale), we define perceptions of tenure to be secure if: (i) The landholder does not report a fear of involuntary loss of the land within the next five years due to, for example, intra-family, community or external threats and (ii) The landholder reports having the right to bequeath the land. Total adult population: A country’s adult population2 is measured by census data or through surveys using an adequate sampling frame. Interpretation: One motivation that makes the indicator actionable is that, in many developing countries, the gap between data on the availability of documentation and on perception of tenure security can be large. For example, tenure may be perceived as secure, even though rights are not formally documented, as in the case of customary systems and trusted local land governance arrangements. Or, the opposite, tenure may be 1 Group rights include shared or collective rights, and examples include the ejido in Mexico, indigenous territories in Honduras, perpetual DUAT for rural communities in Mozambique. Collective rights occur in a situation where holders of rights to land and natural resources are clearly defined as a collective group and have the right to exclude third parties from the enjoyment of those rights. 2 Country specific legal definition of an ‘adult’ will be applied. Last reviewed: August 2021 perceived as insecure even when there is a high level of formal documentation of rights. The latter situation can be caused by various factors, including limited trust in land administration services, possible duplicated documents, high cost of having state institutions protecting such rights. Reporting on perceived security will provide important information on people’s satisfaction with the institutional quality of service, transparency, appropriateness, accessibility and affordability of land administration services and justice systems.</td>\n",

Rationale: The indicator measures the extent to which public spending in three key areas which are critical for poverty eradication, including health, education, and other direct transfers is directly allocated to individuals or households in the monetary poor as per the national definition. The indicator measures if public spending is targeting the monetary poor. Pro-poor social spending is defined if the proportion of government expenditures on social services is higher than the proportion of the population, measured at the level determined by national definition of income/consumption poverty (consistent with SDG 1.2.1). For instance, if the proportion of public spending received by the poor exceeds (falls below) the proportion of poor as defined by national definitions, public expenditures can be interpreted as pro-poor (not pro-poor). This is a strong measurement of the financial commitment governments make to target their services and transfers on the poor groups of society, reinforcing pro-poor development strategies. Further developments of the methodology and improvements in data availability may allow to expand this indicator to other vulnerable groups, such as women and children.</td>\n",

It corresponds to agricultural land area of the farms that satisfy the sustainability criteria of the 11 sub-indicators selected across all three dimensions. • The denominator in turn the sum of agricultural land area (as defined by FAO) utilized by agricultural holdings that are owned (excluding rented-out), rented-in, leased, sharecropped or borrowed. State or communal land used by farm holdings is not included. Please see the methodological document prepared by FAO for a more detailed explanation. The scope of indicator 2.4.1 is the agricultural farm holding, and more precisely the agricultural land area of the farm holding, i.e. land used primarily to grow crops and raise livestock. This choice of scope is fully consistent with the intended use of a country’s agricultural land area as the denominator of the aggregate indicator. Specifically the following are: Included within scope: • Intensive and extensive crops and livestock production systems. • Subsistence agriculture. • State and common land when used exclusively and managed by the farm holding. • Food and non-food crops and livestock products (e.g. tobacco, cotton, and sheep wool). • Crops grown for fodder or for energy purposes. • Agro-forestry (trees on the agriculture areas of the farm). • Aquaculture, to the extent that it takes place within the agricultural land area. For example, rice-fish farming and similar systems. Excluded from scope: • State and common land not used exclusively by the farm holding. • Nomadic pastoralism. • Production from gardens and backyards. Production from hobby farms2. • Holdings focusing exclusively on aquaculture. • Holdings focusing exclusively on forestry. • Food harvested from the wild.</td>\n",

Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with major impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality Last updated: 2 February 2021 monitoring data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least 80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies, expressed as a percentage.</td>\n",

Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as the numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in accordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III. Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of nonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as the denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital. Nonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the numerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions) as the denominator. Return on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period. Liquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as the numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking the broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, this indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. Net open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be calculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital should be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.</td>\n",

In estimating the land consumption rate, one needs to define what constitutes “consumption” of land since this may cover aspects of “consumed” or “preserved” or available for “development” for cases such as land occupied by \\nwetlands. Secondly, there is not one unequivocal measure of whether land that is being developed is truly “newly-developed” (or vacant) land, or if it is at least partially “redeveloped”.

They provide development services and humanitarian relief, innovate in service delivery, build local capacity and advocate with and for the poor. Acting alone, however, their impact is limited in scope, scale and sustainability. CSOs need to engage in government policy processes more effectively. The development of sustainable human settlements calls for the active engagement of all key stakeholders with particular attention to project/programme beneficiaries and vulnerable groups. Therefore local and national governments should strive to: a) facilitate and protect people’s participation and civic engagement through independent civil society organizations that can be from diverse backgrounds - local, national, and international; b) promote civic and human rights education and training programmes to make urban residents aware of their rights and the changing roles of diverse women, men, and young women and men in urban settings; c) remove the barriers that block participation of socially marginalized groups and promote non-discrimination and the full and equal participation of women, young men and women and marginalized groups. To monitor this indicator fully, it is important to define cities as unique entities and define what constitutes direct participation structures of civil society. Urban planning and management are more clear concepts that UN-Habitat has worked on developing for the last few decades and these are well articulated in the urban agenda documents. Experts who have worked on the methodological developments of this indicator have there put forth the below definitions to help guide the work on this indicator. Rationale: This indicator measures the progress and willingness of elected officials, urban managers and planners to integrate resident and civil society participation in urban planning and management at various levels. Local authorities and governments, along with the international community, are increasingly recognizing the value of civil society and residents’ participation in strengthening the urban development processes. This people-centered approach is key in guiding urban development processes for local ownership, and the implementation of community projects at citywide or local levels. Civil society and public participation fosters a positive relationship between government and the public by communicating effectively and solving the conflicts in a cooperative manner. In many cases when urban planning decisions are made without consultation, the desired results are not achieved and there is a negative impact on society, due to inefficient allocation and use of resources. Ensuring that wide Last updated: November 2018 varieties of opinions are considered assists the decision makers with understanding the interlinkages and nature of problems and potential solutions facing different urban settings. Urban development is a reflection of ideology and national institutions. Public participation means a broader consensus is built and this greatly enhances political interaction between citizens and government, and enhances the legitimacy of the planning process and the plan itself. A plan is more effective if a broad coalition supports the proposal and works together to deliver it. Civil society and public participation in urban management and governance also shows respect to participants’ opinion, needs, aspirations and assets. It can boost their enthusiasm for citizenship and politics, and strengthens their influence in urban planning and public life. When conflicting claims and views are considered, there is a much higher possibility that public trust and buy-in increases in the outcome. This has broader implications for building an active, inclusive and equitable society and more inclusive and sustainable urban environments.</td>\n",

It quantifies the parameters listed below, which are essential for planning and implementing sustainable Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). In most cases, these variables are generally compatible with those collected through the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics (waste section). a) Total MSW generated in the city (tonnes/day) b) Total MSW collected in the city (tonnes/day) c) Proportion of population with access to basic MSW collection services in the city (%) d) Total MSW managed in controlled facilities in the city (tonnes/day) e) MSW composition It is important to realize that part (b) total MSW collected and (c) proportion of the population with access to basic MSW collection services are two different concepts. While part (b) refers to amounts of waste reaching waste management facilities, part (c) considers the population who receive waste collection services. In some cities it is common to dump waste ‘collected’ from households into the surrounding areas instead of transporting it to a disposal or recovery facility. In this case the household has waste collection services, but the collected waste is polluting the environment. Therefore, it is possible that a city has a high proportion of population with access to basic waste collection services, but the amount of MSW collected and transported to waste management facilities is low. Although part (c) is covered by SDG 1 (“End poverty in all its forms everywhere”), under target 1.4 and SDG indicator 1.4.1 which focuses on universal access to basic services, with a particular emphasis on poor and vulnerable groups, this document provides guidelines, quality ladders and household questionnaires to measure the proportion of the population with access to ‘basic’ MSW collection services. The household questionnaire can be integrated into the national census or global household survey mechanism such as Demographic and Health Survey or UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Due to the lack of standardized concepts and definitions that differentiate these two concepts, many cities report the proportion of collected MSW in their own terms. Therefore, this metadata distinguishes clearly between part (b) and (c) and offers introduction to the approaches to monitor and report on part (c).</td>\n",

Since 2016UN-Habitat and \\npartners organized global consultations and discussions to narrow down the set of meaningful definitions that would be helpful for the global monitoring and reporting \\nprocess. Following consultations with 86 member states, the United Nations Statistical \\nCommission, in its 51st Session (March 2020) endorsed the Degree of Urbanisation \\n(DEGURBA) as a workable method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for \\ninternational statistical comparisons. 1 This definition combines population size and \\npopulation density thresholds to classify the entire territory of a country along the \\nurban-rural continuum, and captures the full extent of a city, including the dense \\nneighbourhoods beyond the boundary of the central municipality. DEGURBA is applied \\nin a two-step process: First, 1 km2 grid cells are classified based on population density, \\ncontiguity and population size. Subsequently, local units are classified as urban or rural \\nbased on the type of grid cells in which majority of their population resides. For the \\ncomputation of indicator 11.7.1, countries are encouraged to adopt the degree of \\nurbanisation to define the analysis area (city or urban area). \\nb) Built-up area of cities: Conventionally, built up areas of cities are areas occupied by \\nbuildings and other artificial surfaces. For indicator 11.7.1, built up areas, as the \\nindicator denominator has the same meaning as “city” (see definition of city above).  \\n \\nPublic space: The Global Public Space toolkit defines Public Space as all places that \\nare publicly owned or of public use, accessible and enjoyable by all, for free and \\nwithout a profit motive, categorized into streets, open spaces and public facilities. \\nPublic space in general is defined as the meeting or gathering places that exist \\noutside the home and workplace that are generally accessible by members of the \\npublic, and which foster resident interaction and opportunities for contact and \\nproximity. This definition implies a higher level of community interaction and places \\na focus on public involvement rather than public ownership or stewardship. For the \\npurpose of monitoring and reporting on indicator 11.7.1, public space is defined as \\nall places of public use, accessible by all, and comprises open public space and \\nstreets.  \\nc) Open public space: is any open piece of land that is undeveloped or land with no \\nbuildings (or other built structures) that is accessible to the public without charge, and \\nprovides recreational areas for residents and helps to enhance the beauty and \\nenvironmental quality of neighbourhoods.  UN-Habitat recognizes that different cities \\nhave different types of open public spaces, which vary in both size and typology. Based \\non the size of both soft and hard surfaces, open public spaces are broadly classified into \\nsix categories: national/metropolitan open spaces, regional/larger city open spaces, \\ndistrict/city open spaces, neighbourhood open spaces, local/pocket open spaces and \\nlinear open spaces.  Classification of open public space by typology is described by the \\nfunction of the space and can include: green public areas, riparian reserves, parks and \\nurban forests, playground, square, plazas, waterfronts, sports field, community \\ngardens, parklets and pocket parks.  \\n                                                           \\n1 A recommendation on the method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for international statistical \\ncomparisons. https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3j-Recommendation-\\nE.pdf  \\nLast updated: March 2021 \\nd) Potential open public space:  the identification of open public spaces across cities can \\nbe implemented through, among other sources, analysis of high to very high resolution \\nsatellite imagery, from base-maps provided by different organizations (eg \\nOpenStreetMap, Esri, etc) or as crowd-sourced and volunteered data. While these \\nsources provide important baseline data for indicator 11.7.1, some of the identifiable \\nspaces may not meet the criteria of being “accessible to the public without charge”. \\nThe term “potential open public space” is thus used to refer to open public spaces \\nwhich are extracted from the above-mentioned sources (based on their spatial \\ncharacter), but which are not yet validated to confirm if they are accessible to the \\npublic without charge.   \\ne) Streets are defined thoroughfares that are based inside urban areas, towns, cities and \\nneighbourhoods most commonly lined with houses or buildings used by pedestrians or \\nvehicles in order to go from one place to another in the city, interact and to earn a \\nlivelihood. The main purpose of a street is facilitating movement and enabling public \\ninteraction. The following elements are considered as streets space: Streets, avenues \\nand boulevards, pavements, passages and galleries, Bicycle paths, sidewalks, traffic \\nisland, tramways and roundabouts. Elements excluded from street space include plots \\n(either built-up), open space blocks, railways, paved space within parking lots and \\nairports and individual industries. \\nf) \\nLand allocated to streets refers to the total area of the city/urban area  that is occupied \\nby all forms of streets (as defined above). This indicator only includes streets available \\nat the time of data collection and excludes proposed networks.</td>\n",

This standard definition is extended and adapted to country contexts and may include, where applicable terms such as National Urban Plan, Framework, or Strategy as long as they are aligned with the above qualifiers. Similarly, regional development plans follow the same definition, only applied at the subnational level. NUP that responds to population dynamics: This first qualifier examines to what extent the NUP addresses issues to do with population composition, trends and projections in achieving development goals and targets. - Population composition includes size, geographic distribution and density, household size and composition, mobility and migration, age and sex distribution and disaggregation, as specified in SDG target 17.18 - Trends are changes in composition of the population from over time - Projections are expected changes over time that the NUP needs to ensure that they are well addressed. Key questions for the assessment: - To what extent are quality and timely data on urban and rural population composition, trends and projections available for use in the development, implementation and monitoring of NUP or Regional Development Plans (RDPs)? - To what extent do the strategies/interventions of the NUP and/or RDPs refer to population composition, trends and projections over the timeframe of the plan? Ensure balanced territorial development: This second qualifier entails the promotion of a spatially coherent territory that includes a balanced system of human settlements including cities and towns and including urban corridors; that addresses social, economic, environmental and spatial disparities particularly considering the urban-rural continuum. Key questions for the assessment: To what extent does the national urban policy consider the need for balanced development of the territory as a whole including the differentiated yet equivalent development of all types of settlements including villages, cities and towns, including urban corridors? - To what extent are the linkages – social, economic, environmental and spatial – between urban, peri-urban and rural areas consider with the ultimate goal of strengthening the urban-rural continuum? Increase local fiscal space: Local fiscal space is understood as the sum of financial resources available for improved delivery of basic social and economic services at the local level as a result of the budget and related decisions by governments at all levels without any prejudice to the sustainability of a government’s financial position. Key questions for the assessment: - To what extent has the policy made allowance for the provision of local financial resources to provide for the implementation of the policy and for the delivery of essential basic social and economic services - To what extent has the policy assessed the status of human capacities required to effectively use financial resources for the implementation of the policy and the delivery of essential basic social and economic services? Developing: Developing refers to the policy development pathways and processes that consider the feasibility, diagnosis of policy problems and opportunities, the formulation/drafting of the policy until the approval of the policy Implementing: Implementation refers to the realization of the policy proposal through legislative or financial action/commitments, including the continued monitoring and evaluation of that policy \\n\\n</td>\n",

In order to be counted, they will have to comply with a ‘minimum requirement’ in terms of sustainability disclosures reported on (see below). Company: \\nWhile many companies report at the group level, many of their impacts will be local, and some subsidiaries or franchises produce separate sustainability reports.

The indicator measures the sustainability of fish resources based a good balance between human use and ecological conservation. MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points used in fisheries management today.

These are further explained in the Global Ocean Science Report (GOSR) referenced below. Last updated: 15 February 2021 Marine technology as defined in the IOCCGTMT refers to instruments, equipment, vessels, processes and methodologies required to produce and use knowledge to improve the study and understanding of the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas. Toward this end, marine technology may include any of the following components: a) Information and data, in a user-friendly format, on marine sciences and related marine operations and services; b) Manuals, guidelines, criteria, standards, reference materials; c) Sampling and methodology equipment (e.g., for water, geological, biological, chemical samples); d) Observation facilities and equipment (e.g. remote sensing equipment, buoys, tide gauges, shipboard and other means of ocean observation); e) Equipment for in situ and laboratory observations, analysis and experimentation; f) Computer and computer software, including models and modelling techniques; g) Expertise, knowledge, skills, technical/scientific/legal know-how and analytical methods related to marine scientific research and observation. Indicator 14.a.1 shows the annual national research budget allocated by governments in the field of marine technology, relative to the overall national governmental research and development budget in general. Unit: percentage; raw data in national currency. The proportion can be calculated, and if needed, data can be converted by the international agency into USD.</td>\n",

The environmental values of forests are covered by three sub-indicators Last updated: February 2021 focused on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources. Social and economic values of forests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-indicator provides further qualification to the management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are independently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards. The sub-indicators are: 1. Annual forest area change rate 2. Above-ground biomass stock in forest 3. Proportion of forest area located within legally established protect areas 4. Proportion of forest area under a long-term forest management plan 5. Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme A dashboard is used to assess progress related to the five sub-indicators.

While the term ‘human rights advocate’ is broadly speaking a synonymous of ‘human rights defender,’ the latter is preferred as it is more consistent with internationally agreed human rights standards and established practice. The different categories of violations tracked by the indicator have been defined in accordance with international law and methodological standards and monitoring practices developed by the OHCHR and other international mechanisms and classified drawing on the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) disseminated by the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

Rationale: This indicator seeks to measure enjoyment of fundamental freedoms (e.g. freedom of opinion, freedom of expression and access to information, the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of association) on the premise that killing, enforced disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, kidnapping and other harmful act against journalists, trade unionists and human rights defenders have a chilling effect on the exercise of these fundamental freedoms. What distinguishes this 4 Last updated: 08 June 2018 indicator from Indicator 16.1.1 (number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population by sex and age) aside from the broader scope of violent incidents, is the motivation or causal factor, i.e. that the violation was motivated by the victim having stood up to defend the rights of others, exercise fundamental freedoms, or have occurred while the victim was engaged in such activities. Alongside indicator 16.10.2 (number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information) this indicator provides both a micro and macro-level snapshot of the state of the aforementioned fundamental freedoms in various contexts, as well as a link to the processes and structures required to meet human rights obligations with respect to those fundamental freedoms.</td>\n",

Based on the definition above, the indicator has two components: 1. Adoption Last updated: July 2021 2. Implementation Under each component, key questions were identified based on what can be called “Principles of Access to Information”, and which highlight essential components for effective implementation of Access to Information implementation at the country level. These Principles are synthesized from existing frameworks and documents recognised internationally.1 For the purpose of this survey, the principles of relevance are as follows: 1. Legal frameworks for Access to Information 2. Limited exemptions 3. Oversight mechanism 4. Appeals mechanism 5. Record keeping and reporting Each question values between 0 and 2. Upon the completion of the survey, a country can get a total score of 0-9. The total score of each country will not be assigned to any level category (e.g.: low, medium or high). However, it will contribute to global aggregates. More details on the computation method are under the section Methodology.</td>\n",

following four series are used to monitor the SDG 1.2.2. 1) Official multidimensional poverty headcount, by sex, and age (% of population) - The percentage of people who are multidimensionally poor 2) Average share of weighted deprivations (intensity) for total population - The average share of weighted dimensions in which poor people are deprived among total population 3) Official multidimensional poverty headcount (% of total households) - The percentage of households who are multidimensionally poor 4) Average share of weighted deprivations (intensity) for total households - The average share of weighted dimensions in which poor people are deprived among total households Last updated: May 2021 5) Multidimensional deprivation for children (% of population under 18) - The percentage of

The basis cervices indicator will be therefore based on 9 components. These components\\nare captured in various standalone indicators of the SDGs, which means that the concepts and definitions\\nof SDG indicator 1.4.1 will be derived from or are the same as those of these specific SDG indicators.\\nAccess to basic services implies that sufficient and affordable service is reliably available with adequate\\nquality.\\n1) Access to Basic Drinking Water Services refers to the use of drinking water from an improved\\nsource that is available with a collection time of not more than 30 minutes for a round trip,\\nincluding queuing. Improved sources include: piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected\\ndug wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water. This definition is based on the\\nJMP drinking water ladder and is the foundation for SDG indicator 6.1.1 - Proportion of\\npopulation using safely managed drinking water services.\\n2) Access to Basic Sanitation Services refers to the use of improved facilities that are not shared\\nwith other households. Improved facilities include: flush/pour flush to piped sewer systems,\\nseptic tanks or pit latrines; ventilated improved pit latrines, composting toilets or pit latrines with\\nslabs. This definition is based on the JMP sanitation ladder and is the foundation for SDG\\nindicator 6.2.1 - Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a\\nhand-washing facility with soap and water.\\n3) Access to Basic Hygiene Facilities refers to availability of a handwashing facility on premises with\\nsoap and water. Handwashing facilities may be fixed or mobile and include a sink with tap water,\\nbuckets with taps, tippy-taps, and jugs or basins designated for handwashing. Soap includes bar\\nsoap, liquid soap, powder detergent, and soapy water but does not include ash, soil, sand or\\nother handwashing agents. This definition is based on the JMP hygiene ladder and is the\\nfoundation for SDG indicator 6.2.1 - Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation\\nservices and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water.\\nFor many low and middle-income countries, achieving universal access to basic drinking water, sanitation\\nand hygiene remains a high priority, which will help them achieve access to ‘safely managed services’, the\\ntarget for SDGs 6.1 and 6.2. \\n4) Access to clean fuels and technology refers to use of fuels and technology that are defined by\\nthe emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and\\nkerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household\\nfuel combustion. This component will be captured through SDG 7.1.2 - Percentage of population\\nwith primary reliance on clean fuels and technology.\\n5) Access to Basic Mobility refers to having convenient access to transport in a rural context (SDG\\n9.1.1) or having convenient access to public transport in an urban context (SDG 11.2.1).\\n• Access to mobility rural context\\nTo eradicate poverty, communities need to be connected to socio-economic opportunities\\nby roads that are passable all season and attract reliable and affordable public transport\\nservices. In many areas, safe footpaths, footbridges and waterways may be required in\\nconjunction with, or as an alternative, to roads. For reasons of simplification, specific\\nemphasis was given to roads in this definition (based on the Rural Access Index - RAI -\\npercentage of the population <2km from an all-season road (equivalent to a walk of 20-25\\nmins)1\\n)\\n2\\nsince road transport reflects accessibility for the great majority of people in rural\\ncontexts. In those situations where another mode, such as water transport is dominant the\\ndefinition will be modified and contextualized to reflect and capture those aspects. Access to\\nmobility has shown some of the largest impacts on poverty reduction and has a strong\\ncorrelation to educational, economic and health outcomes (“transport as an enabler”).\\nRAI is the most widely accepted metric for tracking access to transport in rural areas and has\\nbeen included in the SDGs as SDG indicator 9.1.1 - Proportion of the rural population who live\\nwithin 2 km of an all-season road. This component will be therefore captured through SDG\\n9.1.1.\\nThe existing RAI methodology relies on household level survey data – however, is currently\\nbeing revised into a GIS-based index that exploits advances in digital technology with the aim\\nto create a more accurate and cost-effective tool.\\n• Access to mobility urban context\\nThe urban context of access to transport is measured utilizing the methodology of SDG\\n11.2.1 –Proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport by sex,\\nage and persons with disabilities.\\nThe metadata methodology is available (UN-Habitat being the custodian agency) and uses a\\ncombination of spatial and qualitative analysis. A 500 m buffer around each public transport\\nstop is used and overlaid with socio-demographic data – in order to identify the population\\nserved. We know that measuring spatial access is not sufficient and does not address the\\ntemporal dimension associated with the availability of public transport. Complementary to\\nthe above, other parameters of tracking the transport target related to street density/ no. of\\nintersections, affordability, or quality in terms of safety, travel time, universal access, are all\\ntracked. \\n6) Access to Basic Waste Collection Services refers to the access that the population have to a\\nreliable waste collection service, including both formal municipal and informal sector services.\\nThis is connected to and will be captured through SDG Indicator 11.6.1 - Proportion of municipal\\nsolid waste collected and managed in controlled facilities out of total municipal waste generated,\\nby cities. A ‘collection service’ may be ‘door to door’ or by deposit into a community container.\\n‘Collection’ includes collection for recycling as well as for treatment and disposal (so includes e.g.\\ncollection of recyclables by itinerant waste buyers). ‘Reliable’ means regular - frequency will\\ndepend on local conditions and on any pre-separation of the waste. For example, both mixed\\nwaste and organic waste are often collected daily in tropical climates for public health reasons,\\nand generally at least weekly; source-separated dry recyclables may be collected less frequently.\\n7) Access to Basic Health Care Services refers to access to services that cover in and out-of-area\\nemergency services, inpatient hospital and physician care, outpatient medical services,\\nlaboratory and radiology services, and preventive health services. Basic health care services also\\nextend to access to limited treatment of mental illness and substance abuse in accordance with\\nminimum standards prescribed by local and national ministries of health. This is connected to\\nand will be measured through SDG indicator 3.8.1 – Coverage of essential health services.\\n8) Access to Basic Education refers to access to education services that provides all learners with\\ncapabilities they require to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods,\\ncontribute to peaceful and democratic societies and enhance individual well-being. This is\\nconnected to and will be captured through SDG 4.1.1 - Proportion of children and young people\\n(a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at\\nleast a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex.\\n9) Access to Basic Information Services refers to having a broadband internet access. Broadband is\\ndefined as technologies that deliver advertised download speeds of at least 256 kbit/s.\\nConnecting the 50% of the world that is still offline means, in large part, ensuring that everyone,\\neverywhere is able to access an internet that is affordable. The main types of broadband services\\nare: 1) Fixed (wired) broadband network, such as DSL, cable modem, high speed leased lines,\\nfibre to- the-home/building, powerline and other fixed (wired) broadband; 2) Terrestrial fixed\\n(wireless) broadband network, such as WiMAX, fixed CDMA; 3) Satellite broadband network (via\\na satellite connection); 4) Mobile broadband network (at least 3G, e.g. UMTS) via a handset and\\n5) Mobile broadband network (at least 3G, e.g. UMTS) via a card (e.g. integrated SIM card in a\\ncomputer) or USB modem. This is connected to and will be captured through SDG 9.c.1 -\\nProportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology.  \n",

resources, as well as access to …, ownership of and control over land and other forms of Last reviewed: August 2021 property, inheritance, natural resources). It measures the results of policies that aim to strengthen tenure security for all, including women and other vulnerable groups. Indicator 1.4.2 covers (a) all types of land use (such as residential, commercial, agricultural, forestry, grazing, wetlands based on standard land-use classification) in both rural and urban areas; and (b) all land tenure types as recognized at the country level, such as freehold, leasehold, public land, customary land. An individual can hold land in his/her own name, jointly with other individuals, as a member of a household, or collectively as member of group1, cooperative or other type of association. Secure tenure rights: comprised of two sub-components: (i) legally recognized documentation and (ii) perception of the security of tenure, which are both necessary to provide a full measurement of tenure security. Legally recognized documentation: Legal documentation of rights refers to the recording and publication of information on the nature and location of land, rights and right holders in a form that is recognized by government, and is therefore official. For purposes of computing SDG Indicator 1.4.2, the country specific metadata will define what documentation on land rights will be counted as legally recognized (see next section for rationale). Perceived security of tenure: Perception of tenure security refers to an individual’s perception of the likelihood of involuntary loss of land, such as disagreement of the ownership rights over land or ability to use it, regardless of the formal status and can be more optimistic or pessimistic. Although those without land rights’ documentation may frequently be perceived to be under threat, and those with documentation perceived as protected, there may be situations where documented land rights alone are insufficient to guarantee tenure security. Conversely, even without legally recognized documentation, individuals may feel themselves to be protected against eviction or dispossession. Therefore, capturing and analysing these diverse ranges of situations will enable a more comprehensive understanding of land tenure security, based on a country specific context. For purposes of constructing the indicator (see next section for rationale), we define perceptions of tenure to be secure if: (i) The landholder does not report a fear of involuntary loss of the land within the next five years due to, for example, intra-family, community or external threats and (ii) The landholder reports having the right to bequeath the land. Total adult population: A country’s adult population2 is measured by census data or through surveys using an adequate sampling frame. Interpretation: One motivation that makes the indicator actionable is that, in many developing countries, the gap between data on the availability of documentation and on perception of tenure security can be large. For example, tenure may be perceived as secure, even though rights are not formally documented, as in the case of customary systems and trusted local land governance arrangements. Or, the opposite, tenure may be 1 Group rights include shared or collective rights, and examples include the ejido in Mexico, indigenous territories in Honduras, perpetual DUAT for rural communities in Mozambique. Collective rights occur in a situation where holders of rights to land and natural resources are clearly defined as a collective group and have the right to exclude third parties from the enjoyment of those rights. 2 Country specific legal definition of an ‘adult’ will be applied. Last reviewed: August 2021 perceived as insecure even when there is a high level of formal documentation of rights. The latter situation can be caused by various factors, including limited trust in land administration services, possible duplicated documents, high cost of having state institutions protecting such rights. Reporting on perceived security will provide important information on people’s satisfaction with the institutional quality of service, transparency, appropriateness, accessibility and affordability of land administration services and justice systems.  \n",

2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. One of the targets is: “Substantially increase the\\nnumber of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020”.\\nIn line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction\\nstrategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all\\nsectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should\\nbe aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening\\nof economic, social, health and environmental resilience.  \n",

                                Total official development assistance (ODA) grants from all donors that focus on poverty reduction as a share of the recipient country’s gross national income. The OECD/Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as “flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). Poverty reduction items can be defined as ODA to basic social services (basic health, basic education, basic water and sanitation, population programmes and reproductive health) and developmental food aid (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm). Rationale: Total ODA flows to developing countries quantify the public effort (excluding non- concessional flows and export credits), that all donors provide for the economic development and welfare of developing countries. Within ODA, basic social services and development food aid focus on poverty alleviation in developing countries.  \n",

       Proportion of government spending towards health and education and direct transfers which benefit directly the monetary poor. Government spending measures public expenditures on health and education services. Direct transfers refer to cash transfers and near-cash transfers. The definition of the monetary poor follows national standards, with poverty levels determined by national definition of income or consumption poverty (consistent with SDG 1.2.1). Rationale: The indicator measures the extent to which public spending in three key areas which are critical for poverty eradication, including health, education, and other direct transfers is directly allocated to individuals or households in the monetary poor as per the national definition. The indicator measures if public spending is targeting the monetary poor. Pro-poor social spending is defined if the proportion of government expenditures on social services is higher than the proportion of the population, measured at the level determined by national definition of income/consumption poverty (consistent with SDG 1.2.1). For instance, if the proportion of public spending received by the poor exceeds (falls below) the proportion of poor as defined by national definitions, public expenditures can be interpreted as pro-poor (not pro-poor). This is a strong measurement of the financial commitment governments make to target their services and transfers on the poor groups of society, reinforcing pro-poor development strategies. Further developments of the methodology and improvements in data availability may allow to expand this indicator to other vulnerable groups, such as women and children.  \n",

Last updated: 15 February 2021 FAO proposes to define small-scale food producers as producers who: • operate an amount of land falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of land size at national level (measured in hectares); and • operate a number of livestock falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of the number of livestock per production unit at national level (measured in Tropical Livestock Units – TLUs); and • obtain an annual economic revenue from agricultural activities falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of economic revenues from agricultural activities per production unit at national level (measured in Purchasing Power Parity Dollars) not exceeding 34,387 Purchasing Power Parity Dollars.  \n",

of food and agricultural products. This includes income from crop production, livestock production, fisheries and aquaculture production, and from forestry production. The indicator is computed as annual income. FAO proposes to define small-scale food producers as producers who: Last updated: 15 February 2021 • operate an amount of land falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of land size at national level (measured in hectares); and • operate a number of livestock falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of the number of livestock per production unit at national level (measured in Tropical Livestock Units – TLUs); and • obtain an annual economic revenue from agricultural activities falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of economic revenues from agricultural activities per production unit at national level (measured in Purchasing Power Parity Dollars) not exceeding 34,387 Purchasing Power Parity Dollars.  \n",

𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝐴𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎1 This implies the need to measure both the extent of land under productive and sustainable agriculture (the numerator), as well as the extent of agriculture land area (the denominator). • The numerator captures the three dimensions of sustainable production: environmental, economic and social. It corresponds to agricultural land area of the farms that satisfy the sustainability criteria of the 11 sub-indicators selected across all three dimensions. • The denominator in turn the sum of agricultural land area (as defined by FAO) utilized by agricultural holdings that are owned (excluding rented-out), rented-in, leased, sharecropped or borrowed. State or communal land used by farm holdings is not included. Please see the methodological document prepared by FAO for a more detailed explanation. The scope of indicator 2.4.1 is the agricultural farm holding, and more precisely the agricultural land area of the farm holding, i.e. land used primarily to grow crops and raise livestock. This choice of scope is fully consistent with the intended use of a country’s agricultural land area as the denominator of the aggregate indicator. Specifically the following are: Included within scope: • Intensive and extensive crops and livestock production systems. • Subsistence agriculture. • State and common land when used exclusively and managed by the farm holding. • Food and non-food crops and livestock products (e.g. tobacco, cotton, and sheep wool). • Crops grown for fodder or for energy purposes. • Agro-forestry (trees on the agriculture areas of the farm). • Aquaculture, to the extent that it takes place within the agricultural land area. For example, rice-fish farming and similar systems. Excluded from scope: • State and common land not used exclusively by the farm holding. • Nomadic pastoralism. • Production from gardens and backyards. Production from hobby farms2. • Holdings focusing exclusively on aquaculture. • Holdings focusing exclusively on forestry. • Food harvested from the wild.  \n",

of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA) in medium or long term conservation facilities (ex situ, in genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm. The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use Last updated: March 2021 and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm. The two components of the indicator 2.5.1, plant (a) and animal (b) GRFA, are separately counted. The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium or long term conditions, where an ‘accession’ is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank. Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (accessible at http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/), set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key international policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary standards have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Fourteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf).  \n",

                                     The Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) for Government Expenditures is defined as the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, divided by the Agriculture value added share of GDP, where Agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector. The measure is a currency-free index, calculated as the ratio of these two shares. National governments are requested to compile Government Expenditures according to the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) and the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG), and Agriculture value added share of GDP according to the System of National Accounts (SNA).  \n",

Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of their\\nSchedules;\\n• Notifications of export subsidies by developing country Members pursuant to the provisions of article\\n9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture.\\nOther WTO Members are not entitled to use export subsidies and their notifications are therefore not\\nrecorded in the indicator series.\\nBudgetary

For Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included\\nin part IV of their Schedules, the currency used in the notifications is similar to the one used in the\\nSchedules.\\nData are available by country and by products or groups of products, according to Members' schedules\\nfor Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of their Schedules and\\naccording to Member's notification practices in the case of developing country Members using export\\nsubsidies under the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture.\"  \n",

of food price anomalies (IFPA) identifies market prices that are abnormally high. The IFPA relies on a weighted compound growth rate that accounts for both within year and across year price growth. The indicator directly evaluates growth in prices over a particular month over many years, taking into account seasonality in agricultural markets and inflation, allowing to answer the question of whether or not a change in price is abnormal for any particular period.  \n",

ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth. Maternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period.   \n",

indicator is measured indirectly through the proportion of children 5 years of age who have developed chronic HBV infection (i.e. the proportion that tests positive for a marker of infection called hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]).Hepatitis B surface antigen: a protein from the virus’s coat. A positive test for HBsAg indicates active HBV infection. The immune response to HBsAg provides the basis for immunity against HBV, and HBsAg is the main component of HepB.  \n",

a year divided by the total number of people with substance use disorders in the same year. This indicator is disaggregated by two broad groups of psychoactive substances: (1) drugs, (2) alcohol and other psychoactive substances. Whenever possible, this indicator is additionally disaggregated by type of treatment interventions (pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services). The proposed indicator will be accompanied, with contextual information on availability coverage, i.e. treatment capacity for substance use disorders generated at national level to provide additional information for interpretation of the contact coverage data.   \n",

context as alcohol per capita consumption\\n(aged 15 years and older) within a calendar year in litres of pure alcohol\\nTotal alcohol per capita (15+ years) consumption (APC) is defined as the total (sum of three-year average\\nrecorded APC and unrecorded APC adjusted for tourist consumption) amount of pure alcohol consumed\\nper adult (15+ years), in a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol. Recorded alcohol consumption refers to\\nofficial statistics at country level (production, import, export, and sales or taxation data), while the\\nunrecorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of\\ngovernmental control, such as home or informally produced alcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol,\\nsurrogate alcohol (which is alcohol not intended for human consumption), or alcohol obtained through\\ncross-border shopping (which is recorded in a different jurisdiction). Tourist consumption takes into\\naccount tourists visiting the country and inhabitants visiting other countries. Positive figures denote alcohol consumption of outbound tourists being greater than alcohol consumption by inbound tourists,\\nnegative numbers the opposite. Tourist consumption is based on UN statistics, and data are provided by\\nIHME.  \n",

                       The mortality attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution can be expressed as: Number of deaths, Death rate. Death rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years). Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate: - Acute respiratory infections in young children (estimated under 5 years of age); - Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25 years); - Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); and - Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).  \n",

require data for the specific groups of interest. They represent the ratio of the indicator value for one group to that of the other. Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is placed in the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.  \n",

Proportion of girls and women aged 15-49 years who have undergone female genital mutilation. 1 The official indicator name refers to ‘female genital mutilation/cutting’, or FGM/C. In recent years the convention within UNICEF and partner organizations has shifted to referring to ‘female genital mutilation’, or FGM, a term which is now used interchangeably with FGM/C throughout the metadata. Other common terms for the practice include ‘female circumcision’ and ‘excision’. The custodian will request the IAEG-SDGs to consider a refinement of the indicator name to reflect this change for consideration at the UN Statistical Commission in 2022. Last updated: March 2021 This indicator can be measured among smaller age groups, with the experience of younger women representing FGM/C that has occurred more recently and the experience of older women representing levels of the practice in the past. At the regional and global level, this indicator is currently being reported as the proportion of adolescent girls aged 15-19 years who have undergone female genital mutilation.  \n",

number of seats held by women members in single or lower chambers of national parliaments, expressed as a percentage of all occupied seats. National parliaments can be bicameral or unicameral. This indicator covers the single chamber in unicameral parliaments and the lower chamber in bicameral parliaments. It does not cover the upper chamber of bicameral parliaments. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Last updated: 24 August 2021 Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members and by-election. Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, or the number of members of parliament.  \n",

                                                               This indicator refers to the proportion of females in the total number of persons employed in managerial positions. It is recommended to use two different measures jointly for this indicator: the share of females in (total) management and the share of females in senior and middle management (thus excluding junior management). The joint calculation of these two measures provides information on whether women are more represented in junior management than in senior and middle management, thus pointing to an eventual ceiling for women to access higher-level management positions. In these cases, calculating only the share of women in (total) management would be misleading, in that it would suggest that women hold positions with more decision-making power and responsibilities than they actually do.  \n",

union) who make their own decision on all three selected areas i.e. decide on their own health care; decide on use of contraception; and can say no to sexual intercourse with their husband or partner if they do not want. Only women who provide a “yes” answer to all three components are considered as women who make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health. A union involves a man and a woman regularly cohabiting in a marriagelike relationship.  \n",

                           Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 5.6.2 seeks to measure the extent to which countries have national laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years and older to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education. Last updated: March 2021 The indicator is a percentage (%) scale of 0 to 100 (national laws and regulations exist to guarantee full and equal access), indicating a country’s status and progress in the existence of such national laws and regulations. Indicator 5.6.2 measures only the existence of laws and regulations; it does not measure their implementation.  \n",

which the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women’s equal rights to land ownership and/or control. The indicator “measures” the level to which a country’s legal framework supports women’s land rights, by testing that framework against six proxies drawn from international law and internationally accepted good practices , in particular the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) ratified by 189 countries, and the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of the Tenure of Land Fisheries and Forestry (VGGT) endorsed unanimously by Committee of Food Security (CFS) members in 2012. Last updated: 10 February 2021 The six proxies through which indicator 5.a.2 is monitored are the following: Proxy A: Joint registration of land compulsory or encouraged through economic incentives Proxy B: Compulsory spousal consent for land transactions Proxy C: Women’s and girls’ equal inheritance rights Proxy D: Allocation of financial resources to increase women’s ownership and control over land Proxy E: In legal systems that recognise customary land tenure, existence of explicit protection of the land rights of women Proxy F: Mandatory quotas for women’s participation in land management and administration institutions  \n",

safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water is currently being measured by the proportion of the population using a basic sanitation facility which is not shared with other households and where excreta is safely disposed in situ or treated off-site. ‘Improved’ sanitation facilities include: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets. Population with a basic handwashing facility: a device to contain, transport or regulate the flow of water to facilitate handwashing with soap and water in the household.  \n",

which are safely treated before discharge into the environment. Both of these indicators are measured in units of 1000 m3/day, although some data sources may use other units that require conversion. The ratio of the volume treated to the volume generated is taken as the ‘proportion of wastewater flow safely treated’. Wastewater flows will be classified into industrial, services, and domestic flows, with reference to the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities Revision 4 (ISIC). To the extent possible, the proportion of each of these waste streams that is safely treated before discharge to the environment will be calculated.  \n",

defined as the proportion of water bodies in the country that have good ambient water quality. Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with major impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality Last updated: 2 February 2021 monitoring data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least 80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies, expressed as a percentage.  \n",

                                                         Indicator 6.5.1 is ‘degree of integrated water resources management implementation’. It measures the stages of development and implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), on a Last updated: 2 February 2021 scale of 0 to 100, in six categories (see Rationale section). The indicator score is calculated from a country survey with 33 questions, with each question scored on the same scale of 0-100. The definition of IWRM is based on an internationally agreed definition, and is universally applicable. IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is defined as “a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.” (GWP 2010). The method builds on official UN IWRM status reporting, from 2008 and 2012, of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the UN World Summit for Sustainable Development (1992).  \n",

“transboundary basin” area within a country covered by an “operational” “arrangement for water cooperation”. A “transboundary basin” refers to a river or lake basin, or an aquifer system that marks, crosses or is located on boundaries between two or more states. A basin comprises the entire catchment area of a surface water body (river or lake), or for groundwater, the area of the aquifer, i.e. the entire permeable water-bearing geological formation. For the purpose of calculating the value of SDG indicator 6.5.2 the transboundary basin area is the extent of the catchment area (river or lake basin); or the extent of the aquifer. Last updated: July 2021 “Arrangement for water cooperation” refers to a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or other formal arrangement, such as memorandum of understanding between countries sharing transboundary basins that provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Agreements or other kinds of formal arrangements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial, interagency or between regional authorities. “Operational” means that an agreement for cooperation between the countries sharing transboundary basins meets all the following criteria: - There is a joint body or mechanism (e.g. a river basin organization) for transboundary cooperation; - There are regular, i.e., at least annual, formal communications between riparian countries in form of meetings (either at the political and/or technical level); - There is a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or joint objectives have been set; - There is a regular, i.e., at least annual, exchange of data and information.  \n",

                                Indicator 6.6.1 tracks the extent to which different types of water-related ecosystems are changing in extent over time. The indicator is multifaceted capturing data on different types of freshwater ecosystems and to measure extent change the indicator considers spatial area changes, water quality and water quantity changes. The indicator uses satellite based Earth observations to globally monitor different freshwater ecosystems types Earth observation data series on surface area are available on permanent water, seasonal water, reservoirs, wetlands, mangroves; as well as generating data on water quality the using trophic state and turbidity of water bodies. Satellite images can be represented as numerical data, which in turn are aggregated into meaningful statistics of ecosystem change attributed to administrative areas such as national, sub-national (e.g. regions and provinces) and river basin boundaries. Global data products for river flows and groundwater level have not yet been produced at useful spatial and temporal resolutions to be incorporated into this SDG 6.6.1 methodology. Currently, these data should continue to be provided from modelling or from ground-based measurements and required from the countries.  \n",

indicator assesses the percentage of local administrative units (as defined by the national government) that have an established and operational mechanism by which individuals and communities can meaningfully contribute to decisions and directions about water and sanitation management. The indicator Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is currently being measured by the Proportion of countries with clearly defined procedures in law or policy for participation by service users/communities in planning program in water and sanitation management, and hygiene promotion and the Proportion of countries with high level of users/communities participating in planning programs in water and sanitation management, and hygiene promotion.  \n",

                                            The number of children engaged in child labour corresponds to the number of children reported to be in child labour during the reference period (usually the week prior to the survey). The proportion of children in child labour is calculated as the number of children in child labour divided by the total number of children in the population. For the purposes of this indicator, children include all persons aged 5 to 17.  \n",

indicator provides information on the number of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 workers in the reference group during the reference period. It is a measure of the personal likelihood or risk of having a fatal or a non-fatal occupational injury for each worker in the reference group. The number of occupational injuries expressed per a given number of workers in the reference group is also known as the incidence rate of occupational injuries  \n",

as the sum of the part of gross value added (at basic prices) generated by all industries in response to internal tourism consumption plus the amount of net taxes on products and imports included within the value of this expenditure at purchasers’ prices.

volumes are respectively measured in passenger-km and tonne-km, and broken down by mode of transport. For the purposes of monitoring this indicator, passenger-km data are split between aviation, road (broken down between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles) and rail, and tonne-km are split between aviation, road, rail and inland waterways. As maritime data are not widely available, only tonnes (rather than tonne-km) data at the regional level have been shared.  \n",

CO2) emissions per unit of value added is an indicator computed as ratio\\nbetween CO2 emissions from fuel combustion and the value added of associated economic activities. The\\nindicator can be computed for the whole economy (total CO2 emissions/GDP) or for specific sectors, notably the manufacturing sector (CO2 emissions from manufacturing industries per manufacturing value\\nadded (MVA).\\nCO2 emissions per unit of GDP are expressed in kilogrammes of CO2 per unit of purchasing power parity\\nGDP in constant 2017 USD. CO2 emissions from manufacturing industries per unit of MVA are measured in\\nkilogrammes of CO2 equivalent per unit of MVA in constant 2015 USD.  \n",

        Seven FSIs are included as SDG indicators for 10.5.1 and expressed as percent. 1 - Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets 2 - Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets 3 - Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital Last updated: 03 December 2018 4 - Nonperforming loans to total gross loans 5 - Return on assets 6 - Liquid assets to short-term liabilities 7 - Net open position in foreign exchange to capital Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) assets. Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as the numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in accordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III. Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of nonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as the denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital. Nonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the numerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions) as the denominator. Return on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period. Liquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as the numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking the broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, this indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. Net open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be calculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital should be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.  \n",

                           The MMP data include migrants (regardless of legal status) who have died at the external borders of States or in the process of migration towards an international destination. This selection of data is based on the currently available sources and can provide some insight into the safety or otherwise of routes. Not included in the data collection is information about migrants who die, or go missing, in countries of \\ndestination or residence. Deaths in refugee housing, immigration detention centres or camps are excluded. The MMP data also exclude deaths that occur during deportation or after forced return to a migrant’s homeland or third country, as well as deaths more loosely connected with migrants’ precarious or irregular status, such as those resulting from labour exploitation or resulting from lack of access to health care.  \n",

The first component is that transaction costs for migrant remittances should be 3% or less by 2030. This transaction cost should be intended as “Global average total cost of sending $200 (or equivalent in local sending currency) and expressed as % of amount sent”. This indicator is readily available and published on a quarterly basis by the World Bank in the Remittance Prices Worldwide database, which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending to 105 receiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where cost is 5% or higher. This should be intended in the sense that it should be possible for remittance senders to send money to the beneficiary for an average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should suffice that in each corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a defined set of service requirements (including service quality, reach etc.), for which the average is 5% or less.   \n",

convenient access to public transport. The access to public transport is considered convenient when a stop is accessible within a walking distance along the street network of 500 m from a reference point such as a home, school, work place, market, etc. to a low-capacity public transport system (e.g. bus, Bus Rapid Transit) and/or 1 km to a high-capacity system (e.g. rail, metro, ferry). Additional criteria for defining public transport that is convenient include: Last updated: September 2021 a. Public transport accessible to all special-needs customers, including those who are physically, visually, and/or hearing-impaired, as well as those with temporary disabilities, the elderly, children and other people in vulnerable situations. b. Public transport with frequent service during peak travel times c. Stops present a safe and comfortable station environment   \n",

                                                            The indicator is defined as the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate. This indicator requires defining the two components of population growth and land consumption rate. Computing the population growth rate is more straightforward and more readily available, while land consumption rate is slightly challenging, and requires the use of new techniques. In estimating the land consumption rate, one needs to define what constitutes “consumption” of land since this may cover aspects of “consumed” or “preserved” or available for “development” for cases such as land occupied by \\nwetlands. Secondly, there is not one unequivocal measure of whether land that is being developed is truly “newly-developed” (or vacant) land, or if it is at least partially “redeveloped”. As a result, the percentage of current total urban land that was newly developed (consumed) will be used as a measure of the land consumption rate. The fully developed area is also sometimes referred to as built up area.   \n",

organizations (CSOs) make a difference in international development. They provide development services and humanitarian relief, innovate in service delivery, build local capacity and advocate with and for the poor. Acting alone, however, their impact is limited in scope, scale and sustainability. CSOs need to engage in government policy processes more effectively. The development of sustainable human settlements calls for the active engagement of all key stakeholders with particular attention to project/programme beneficiaries and vulnerable groups. Therefore local and national governments should strive to: a) facilitate and protect people’s participation and civic engagement through independent civil society organizations that can be from diverse backgrounds - local, national, and international; b) promote civic and human rights education and training programmes to make urban residents aware of their rights and the changing roles of diverse women, men, and young women and men in urban settings; c) remove the barriers that block participation of socially marginalized groups and promote non-discrimination and the full and equal participation of women, young men and women and marginalized groups. To monitor this indicator fully, it is important to define cities as unique entities and define what constitutes direct participation structures of civil society. Urban planning and management are more clear concepts that UN-Habitat has worked on developing for the last few decades and these are well articulated in the urban agenda documents. Experts who have worked on the methodological developments of this indicator have there put forth the below definitions to help guide the work on this indicator. Rationale: This indicator measures the progress and willingness of elected officials, urban managers and planners to integrate resident and civil society participation in urban planning and management at various levels. Local authorities and governments, along with the international community, are increasingly recognizing the value of civil society and residents’ participation in strengthening the urban development processes. This people-centered approach is key in guiding urban development processes for local ownership, and the implementation of community projects at citywide or local levels. Civil society and public participation fosters a positive relationship between government and the public by communicating effectively and solving the conflicts in a cooperative manner. In many cases when urban planning decisions are made without consultation, the desired results are not achieved and there is a negative impact on society, due to inefficient allocation and use of resources. Ensuring that wide Last updated: November 2018 varieties of opinions are considered assists the decision makers with understanding the interlinkages and nature of problems and potential solutions facing different urban settings. Urban development is a reflection of ideology and national institutions. Public participation means a broader consensus is built and this greatly enhances political interaction between citizens and government, and enhances the legitimacy of the planning process and the plan itself. A plan is more effective if a broad coalition supports the proposal and works together to deliver it. Civil society and public participation in urban management and governance also shows respect to participants’ opinion, needs, aspirations and assets. It can boost their enthusiasm for citizenship and politics, and strengthens their influence in urban planning and public life. When conflicting claims and views are considered, there is a much higher possibility that public trust and buy-in increases in the outcome. This has broader implications for building an active, inclusive and equitable society and more inclusive and sustainable urban environments.  \n",

in the affected area. Direct economic loss is nearly equivalent to physical damage. a] An open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) is developing a set of \\nindicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework. These indicators will eventually reflect the agreements on the Sendai Framework indicators.   \n",

          SDG 11.6 targets an improved environmental performance of cities and SDG indicator 11.6.1 measures the progress of the performance of a city’s municipal solid waste management. It quantifies the parameters listed below, which are essential for planning and implementing sustainable Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). In most cases, these variables are generally compatible with those collected through the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics (waste section). a) Total MSW generated in the city (tonnes/day) b) Total MSW collected in the city (tonnes/day) c) Proportion of population with access to basic MSW collection services in the city (%) d) Total MSW managed in controlled facilities in the city (tonnes/day) e) MSW composition It is important to realize that part (b) total MSW collected and (c) proportion of the population with access to basic MSW collection services are two different concepts. While part (b) refers to amounts of waste reaching waste management facilities, part (c) considers the population who receive waste collection services. In some cities it is common to dump waste ‘collected’ from households into the surrounding areas instead of transporting it to a disposal or recovery facility. In this case the household has waste collection services, but the collected waste is polluting the environment. Therefore, it is possible that a city has a high proportion of population with access to basic waste collection services, but the amount of MSW collected and transported to waste management facilities is low. Although part (c) is covered by SDG 1 (“End poverty in all its forms everywhere”), under target 1.4 and SDG indicator 1.4.1 which focuses on universal access to basic services, with a particular emphasis on poor and vulnerable groups, this document provides guidelines, quality ladders and household questionnaires to measure the proportion of the population with access to ‘basic’ MSW collection services. The household questionnaire can be integrated into the national census or global household survey mechanism such as Demographic and Health Survey or UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Due to the lack of standardized concepts and definitions that differentiate these two concepts, many cities report the proportion of collected MSW in their own terms. Therefore, this metadata distinguishes clearly between part (b) and (c) and offers introduction to the approaches to monitor and report on part (c).   \n",

These \\ninclude; built-up area, cities, open spaces for public use, etc. As a custodian agency, UN-Habitat has worked on these concepts along with several other partners. a) City: A range of accepted definitions of the “city” exist, from those based on population data and extent of the built-up area to those that are based solely on administrative \\nboundaries. These definitions vary within and between nations, complicating the task \\nof international reporting for the SDGs. Definitions of cities, metropolitan areas and urban agglomerations also vary depending on legal, administrative, political, economic \\nLast updated: March 2021 or cultural criteria in the respective countries and regions. Since 2016UN-Habitat and \\npartners organized global consultations and discussions to narrow down the set of meaningful definitions that would be helpful for the global monitoring and reporting \\nprocess. Following consultations with 86 member states, the United Nations Statistical \\nCommission, in its 51st Session (March 2020) endorsed the Degree of Urbanisation \\n(DEGURBA) as a workable method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for \\ninternational statistical comparisons. 1 This definition combines population size and \\npopulation density thresholds to classify the entire territory of a country along the \\nurban-rural continuum, and captures the full extent of a city, including the dense \\nneighbourhoods beyond the boundary of the central municipality. DEGURBA is applied \\nin a two-step process: First, 1 km2 grid cells are classified based on population density, \\ncontiguity and population size. Subsequently, local units are classified as urban or rural \\nbased on the type of grid cells in which majority of their population resides. For the \\ncomputation of indicator 11.7.1, countries are encouraged to adopt the degree of \\nurbanisation to define the analysis area (city or urban area). \\nb) Built-up area of cities: Conventionally, built up areas of cities are areas occupied by \\nbuildings and other artificial surfaces. For indicator 11.7.1, built up areas, as the \\nindicator denominator has the same meaning as “city” (see definition of city above).  \\n \\nPublic space: The Global Public Space toolkit defines Public Space as all places that \\nare publicly owned or of public use, accessible and enjoyable by all, for free and \\nwithout a profit motive, categorized into streets, open spaces and public facilities. \\nPublic space in general is defined as the meeting or gathering places that exist \\noutside the home and workplace that are generally accessible by members of the \\npublic, and which foster resident interaction and opportunities for contact and \\nproximity. This definition implies a higher level of community interaction and places \\na focus on public involvement rather than public ownership or stewardship. For the \\npurpose of monitoring and reporting on indicator 11.7.1, public space is defined as \\nall places of public use, accessible by all, and comprises open public space and \\nstreets.  \\nc) Open public space: is any open piece of land that is undeveloped or land with no \\nbuildings (or other built structures) that is accessible to the public without charge, and \\nprovides recreational areas for residents and helps to enhance the beauty and \\nenvironmental quality of neighbourhoods.  UN-Habitat recognizes that different cities \\nhave different types of open public spaces, which vary in both size and typology. Based \\non the size of both soft and hard surfaces, open public spaces are broadly classified into \\nsix categories: national/metropolitan open spaces, regional/larger city open spaces, \\ndistrict/city open spaces, neighbourhood open spaces, local/pocket open spaces and \\nlinear open spaces.  Classification of open public space by typology is described by the \\nfunction of the space and can include: green public areas, riparian reserves, parks and \\nurban forests, playground, square, plazas, waterfronts, sports field, community \\ngardens, parklets and pocket parks.  \\n                                                           \\n1 A recommendation on the method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for international statistical \\ncomparisons. https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3j-Recommendation-\\nE.pdf  \\nLast updated: March 2021 \\nd) Potential open public space:  the identification of open public spaces across cities can \\nbe implemented through, among other sources, analysis of high to very high resolution \\nsatellite imagery, from base-maps provided by different organizations (eg \\nOpenStreetMap, Esri, etc) or as crowd-sourced and volunteered data. While these \\nsources provide important baseline data for indicator 11.7.1, some of the identifiable \\nspaces may not meet the criteria of being “accessible to the public without charge”. \\nThe term “potential open public space” is thus used to refer to open public spaces \\nwhich are extracted from the above-mentioned sources (based on their spatial \\ncharacter), but which are not yet validated to confirm if they are accessible to the \\npublic without charge.   \\ne) Streets are defined thoroughfares that are based inside urban areas, towns, cities and \\nneighbourhoods most commonly lined with houses or buildings used by pedestrians or \\nvehicles in order to go from one place to another in the city, interact and to earn a \\nlivelihood. The main purpose of a street is facilitating movement and enabling public \\ninteraction. The following elements are considered as streets space: Streets, avenues \\nand boulevards, pavements, passages and galleries, Bicycle paths, sidewalks, traffic \\nisland, tramways and roundabouts. Elements excluded from street space include plots \\n(either built-up), open space blocks, railways, paved space within parking lots and \\nairports and individual industries. \\nf) \\nLand allocated to streets refers to the total area of the city/urban area  that is occupied \\nby all forms of streets (as defined above). This indicator only includes streets available \\nat the time of data collection and excludes proposed networks.  \n",

harassment and/or sexual harassment, as a percentage of the total population of the relevant area. Rationale: The experience of physical and sexual harassment can have far-reaching negative impacts on the victims. Besides the emotional and psychological harm suffered, harassment can have negative consequences on the ability of its victims to fully participate in public life and to share in and contribute to the development of their communities. For example, the widespread occurrence of sexual harassment in the workplace can lead to a lower participation of women in the workforce, especially in male-dominated occupations, and lower their income-generating capacity.  \n",

of actions derived through a deliberate government led process of coordinating and rallying various actors for a common vision and goal that will promote more transformative, productive, inclusive, and resilient urban development for the long term1. This standard definition is extended and adapted to country contexts and may include, where applicable terms such as National Urban Plan, Framework, or Strategy as long as they are aligned with the above qualifiers. Similarly, regional development plans follow the same definition, only applied at the subnational level. NUP that responds to population dynamics: This first qualifier examines to what extent the NUP addresses issues to do with population composition, trends and projections in achieving development goals and targets. - Population composition includes size, geographic distribution and density, household size and composition, mobility and migration, age and sex distribution and disaggregation, as specified in SDG target 17.18 - Trends are changes in composition of the population from over time - Projections are expected changes over time that the NUP needs to ensure that they are well addressed. Key questions for the assessment: - To what extent are quality and timely data on urban and rural population composition, trends and projections available for use in the development, implementation and monitoring of NUP or Regional Development Plans (RDPs)? - To what extent do the strategies/interventions of the NUP and/or RDPs refer to population composition, trends and projections over the timeframe of the plan? Ensure balanced territorial development: This second qualifier entails the promotion of a spatially coherent territory that includes a balanced system of human settlements including cities and towns and including urban corridors; that addresses social, economic, environmental and spatial disparities particularly considering the urban-rural continuum. Key questions for the assessment: To what extent does the national urban policy consider the need for balanced development of the territory as a whole including the differentiated yet equivalent development of all types of settlements including villages, cities and towns, including urban corridors? - To what extent are the linkages – social, economic, environmental and spatial – between urban, peri-urban and rural areas consider with the ultimate goal of strengthening the urban-rural continuum? Increase local fiscal space: Local fiscal space is understood as the sum of financial resources available for improved delivery of basic social and economic services at the local level as a result of the budget and related decisions by governments at all levels without any prejudice to the sustainability of a government’s financial position. Key questions for the assessment: - To what extent has the policy made allowance for the provision of local financial resources to provide for the implementation of the policy and for the delivery of essential basic social and economic services - To what extent has the policy assessed the status of human capacities required to effectively use financial resources for the implementation of the policy and the delivery of essential basic social and economic services? Developing: Developing refers to the policy development pathways and processes that consider the feasibility, diagnosis of policy problems and opportunities, the formulation/drafting of the policy until the approval of the policy Implementing: Implementation refers to the realization of the policy proposal through legislative or financial action/commitments, including the continued monitoring and evaluation of that policy \\n\\n  \n",

global policy of disaster risk reduction. One of the targets is: “Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020”. In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction strategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience. The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG report A/71/644). The relevant SDG indicators reflect the Sendai Framework indicators.  \n",

Sustainable Consumption and Production: the working definition of Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) used in the context of this framework is: “The use of services and related products, which respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while minimising the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as the emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardise the needs of future generation.”1 • Policy: although quite flexible and contexts specific, a policy is usually defined as a course of action that has been officially agreed by an entity or an organization (governmental or non-governmental) and is effectively implemented to achieve specific objectives. • Policy instruments for sustainable consumption and production: policy instruments refer to the means – methodologies, measures or interventions – that are used to achieve those objectives. In the case of SCP, such instruments are designed and implemented to reduce the environmental impacts of consumption and production patterns, with a view of generating economic and/or social benefits. Making progress along the policy cycle refers to the development, adoption, implementation or evaluation of such policy instruments.   \n",

Index of the changes in food loss over time. The index covers five food groups along the supply chain. The indicator is computed as a ratio of Food Loss \\nPercentages in the current year and the Food Loss Percentages in the base year according to a standard fixed-base index formula. Definition of food loss for SDG monitoring: Food losses - are all the crop and livestock human-edible commodity quantities that, directly or indirectly, completely exit the post-harvest/slaughter production/supply chain by \\nbeing discarded, incinerated or otherwise, and do not re-enter in any other utilization (such as animal feed, industrial use, etc.), up to, and excluding, the retail level. Losses that occur during storage, transportation and processing, also of imported quantities, are therefore all included. Losses include the commodity as a whole with its non-edible parts.  \n",

generated, hazardous waste generated by type (including e-waste as a sub-indicator) and the proportion of hazardous waste treated. For the e-waste sub-category, United Nations University is a co-custodian. Hazardous waste generated (in tonnes, per km sq of land area and per capita): Hazardous waste collected + Hazardous waste given by generator to treatment or disposal facilities + Estimation of Unaccounted for hazardous waste. Hazardous waste generated by type, including e-waste: A breakdown of hazardous waste generated by key type of waste, including e-waste Proportion of hazardous waste treated: Quantity of hazardous waste treated during reporting year/quantity of hazardous waste generated x 100 \\n \\nA full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, “Global Chemicals and \\nWaste Indicator Review Document (UNEP, forthcoming)”.  \n",

to stand-alone sustainability reports produced by companies, but will be considered as ‘reporting sustainability information’ and expanded to other forms of reporting sustainability information, such as publishing sustainability information as part of the company’s annual reports or reporting sustainability information to the national government. This is to ensure that the focus of the indicator is on tracking the publishing of sustainability information, rather than on the practice of publishing stand-alone sustainability reports. It also ensures that the indicator interpretation is aligned with the wording of Target 12.6 which refers to promoting “the integration of sustainability information into the annual reporting cycle of companies”. Not every report called ‘Sustainability Report’ will be counted towards the indicator. In order to be counted, they will have to comply with a ‘minimum requirement’ in terms of sustainability disclosures reported on (see below). Company: \\nWhile many companies report at the group level, many of their impacts will be local, and some subsidiaries or franchises produce separate sustainability reports. As a practice that should be encouraged, and one that is useful to monitor, is therefore proposed to count both the group and subsidiary/franchise level separately, as separate entities.  “Company” can therefore apply to either the parent company, or a franchise or subsidiary, depending on their reporting practices.   \n",

Indicator 4.7.1/12.8.1/13.3.1 measures the extent to which countries mainstream Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in their education systems. This is an indicator of characteristics of different aspects of education systems: education policies, curricula, teacher training and student assessment as reported by government officials, ideally following consultation with other government ministries, national human rights institutes, the education sector and civil society organizations. It measures what governments intend and not what is implemented in practice in schools and classrooms. Last updated: 7 May 2021 For each of the four components of the indicator (policies, curricula, teacher education, and student assessment), a number of criteria are measured, which are then combined to give a single score between zero and one for each component. (See methodology section for full details.) The indicator and its methodology have been reviewed and endorsed by UNESCO’s Technical Cooperation Group on the Indicators for SDG 4-Education 2030 (TCG), which is responsible for the development and maintenance of the thematic indicator framework for the follow-up and review of SDG 4. The TCG also has an interest in education-related indicators in other SDGs, including global indicators 12.8.1 and 13.3.1. The TCG is composed of 38 regionally representative experts from UNESCO Member States (nominated by the respective geographic groups of UNESCO), as well as international partners, civil society, and the Co-Chair of the Education 2030 Steering Committee. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics acts as the Secretariat.  \n",

level, three sub-indicators are recommended for reporting on this indicator: 1) direct transfer of government funds; 2) induced transfers (price support); and as an optional sub-indicator 3) tax expenditure, other revenue foregone, and under-pricing of goods and services. The definitions of the IEA Statistical Manual (IEA, 2005) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) (WTO, 1994) are used to define fossil fuel subsidies. Standardised descriptions from the United Nations Statistical Office’s Central Product Classification should be used to classify individual energy products. It is proposed to drop the wording “as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels” and thus this indicator is effectively \"Amount of fossil fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption)\".  \n",

policy of disaster risk reduction. One of the targets is: “Substantially increase the\\nnumber of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020”.\\nIn line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction\\nstrategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all\\nsectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should\\nbe aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening\\nof economic, social, health and environmental resilience.\\nThe open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to\\ndisaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a\\nset of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was\\nendorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG report A/71/644). The relevant SDG indicators reflect the Sendai\\nFramework indicators.  \n",

                                                 The ultimate objective of the Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) is to achieve the stabilization of\\ngreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous\\nanthropogenic interference with the climate system. Estimating the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG)\\nemissions and removals is an important element of the efforts to achieve this objective.\\nIn accordance with Articles 4 and 12 of the Climate Change Convention and the relevant decisions of the\\nConference of the Parties, countries that are Parties to the Convention submit national GHG inventories\\nto the Climate Change secretariat. These submissions are made in accordance with the reporting\\nrequirements adopted under the Convention, such as the revised “Guidelines for the preparation of\\nnational communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, Part I: UNFCCC reporting\\nguidelines on annual greenhouse gas inventories” (decision 24/CP.19) for Annex I Parties and “Guidelines for the preparation of national communications for non-Annex I Parties” (decision 17/CP.8). The\\ninventory data are provided in the annual GHG inventory submissions by Annex I Parties and in the\\nnational communications and biennial update reports by non-Annex I Parties.\\nThe Paris Agreement adopted in 2015 marks the latest step in the evolution of the UN climate change\\nregime and builds on the work undertaken under the Convention. Its central aim is to strengthen the\\nglobal response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well\\nbelow 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature\\nincrease even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement also aims to strengthen the ability of\\ncountries to deal with the impacts of climate change.   \n",

Indicator 4.7.1/12.8.1/13.3.1 measures the extent to which countries mainstream Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in their education systems. This is an indicator of characteristics of different aspects of education systems: education policies, curricula, teacher training and student assessment as reported by government officials, ideally following consultation with other government ministries, national human rights institutes, the education sector and civil society Last updated: 7 May 2021 organizations. It measures what governments intend and not what is implemented in practice in schools and classrooms. For each of the four components of the indicator (policies, curricula, teacher education, and student assessment), a number of criteria are measured, which are then combined to give a single score between zero and one for each component. (See methodology section for full details.) The indicator and its methodology have been reviewed and endorsed by UNESCO’s Technical Cooperation Group on the Indicators for SDG 4-Education 2030 (TCG), which is responsible for the development and maintenance of the thematic indicator framework for the follow-up and review of SDG 4. The TCG also has an interest in education-related indicators in other SDGs, including global indicators 12.8.1 and 13.3.1. The TCG is composed of 38 regionally representative experts from UNESCO Member States (nominated by the respective geographic groups of UNESCO), as well as international partners, civil society, and the Co-Chair of the Education 2030 Steering Committee. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics acts as the Secretariat.  \n",

Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) to prepare a\\nBiennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows (BA) (decision 2/CP.17 paragraph 121(f)),\\ndrawing on the available sources of information, and including information on the geographical and\\nthematic balance of flows. There is no agreed definition under the UNFCCC on what should count toward\\nassessing progress toward the $100 billion commitment. Data from the UNFCCC secretariat refers to\\nclimate-specific financial support to developing country Parties, reported by Annex I Parties in their Biennial Reports. Only Annex II Parties are obligated to report on financial support provided and other\\nAnnex I Parties also voluntarily provide this information. Consequently, this data should not be\\ninterpreted as an indicator in relation to the achievement of the collective mobilization goal of $100\\nbillion commitment.\\nOne of the functions of the SCF is to assist the COP with respect to the measurement, reporting and\\nverification of the support provided to developing country Parties through activities such as the\\npreparation of the Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows (BA). Subsequently,\\nthe COP requested SCF to consider:\\n• Relevant work by other bodies and entities on the MRV of support and the tracking of\\nclimate finance\\n(decision 1/CP.18 paragraph 71);\\n• Ways of strengthening methodologies for reporting climate finance (decision 5/CP.18\\nparagraph 11);\\n• Ongoing technical work on operational definitions of climate finance, including private\\nfinance mobilized by public interventions, to assess how adaptation and mitigation needs\\ncan most effectively be met by climate finance (decision 3/CP.19, paragraph 11).\\nThe SBSTA. by decision 18/CMA.1, paragraph 12a, was requested to develop the common tabular\\nformats for the electronic reporting of the information referred to in chapters V and VI of the modalities,\\nprocedures and guidelines of enhanced framework, taking into account the existing the existing common\\ntabular formats and common reporting formats.  \n",

SDG 14.1.1a and SDG 14.1.1b will described as two indicators. Across the 14.1.1a and 14.1.1b, two levels are proposed: Level 1: Globally available data from earth observations and modelling Level 2: National data which will be collected from countries (through the relevant Regional Seas Programme, where applicable (i.e. for countries that are a member of a Regional Seas Programme) Level 3: Additional indicators which are suggested that countries might consider collecting (these are not discussed in this document) Last updated: 8 February 2021 The below tables demonstrate the proposed parameters for SDG Target 14.1.1a and 14.1.1b.

(ICZM) is proposed as the primary indicator. For countries with Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) in place, these plans can be helpful to assess ICZM. For other countries, it is important to identify ways to measure existing plans and to build capacity for integrated planning. All data for this indicator will be based on country submissions to the Regional Seas Programme. In order to promote the use of the Regional Seas as part of the follow-up and review mechanism for the Regional Seas, UNEP drafted report on how Regional Seas data could be directly used for the SDGs (see https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/27295/ocean_SDG.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). Last updated: 8 February 2021 A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, “Global Manual on Ocean Statistics for Measuring SDG 14.1.1, 14.2.1 and 14.5.1”.  \n",

the ocean over an extended period, typically of decades\\nor longer, which is caused primarily by the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere1\\n. This indicator is based on observations that constrain the ocean carbon system and which are required to\\ndescribe the variability in ocean acidity. The carbon system in this context mainly refers to the four\\nmeasurable parameters: pH (the concentration of hydrogen ions on a logarithmic scale), DIC (CT; total\\ndissolved inorganic carbon), pCO2 (carbon dioxide partial pressure), and TA (AT, total alkalinity). Average,\\nas used here, is the equally weighed annual mean.\\nAn agreed suite of representative sampling stations are sites that have a measurement frequency that is\\nadequate for describing variability and trends in carbonate chemistry in order to deliver critical\\ninformation on the exposure of and impacts on marine systems to ocean acidification, and which provide\\ndata of sufficient quality and with comprehensive metadata information to enable integration with data\\nfrom other sites in the country.   \n",

sustainable levels, measures the sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries by their abundance. A fish stock whose abundance is at or greater than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable. Last updated: February 2021 MSY is defined as the greatest amount of catch that can be harvested continuously from a stock under constant and current environmental conditions (e.g., habitat, water conditions, species composition and interactions, and anything that could affect birth, growth, or death rates of the stock) without affecting the long-term productivity of the stock. The indicator measures the sustainability of fish resources based a good balance between human use and ecological conservation. MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points used in fisheries management today. This is primarily because, for decades, reference points from surplus production models have most often been set based on the concept of MSY and they are the basic benchmarks for the sustainability of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3)).  \n",

                                                     Definitions and mechanisms used in the development of the SDG indicator 14.a.1 are based on the IOC Criteria and Guidelines on Transfer of Marine Technology – IOCCGTMT (originally published and endorsed by IOC Member States in 2005. These guidelines provide an internationally agreed definition of what is understood by the term marine technology and have been referenced in various UN General Assembly Resolutions and specifically in the formulation of SDG target 14.a. These are further explained in the Global Ocean Science Report (GOSR) referenced below. Last updated: 15 February 2021 Marine technology as defined in the IOCCGTMT refers to instruments, equipment, vessels, processes and methodologies required to produce and use knowledge to improve the study and understanding of the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas. Toward this end, marine technology may include any of the following components: a) Information and data, in a user-friendly format, on marine sciences and related marine operations and services; b) Manuals, guidelines, criteria, standards, reference materials; c) Sampling and methodology equipment (e.g., for water, geological, biological, chemical samples); d) Observation facilities and equipment (e.g. remote sensing equipment, buoys, tide gauges, shipboard and other means of ocean observation); e) Equipment for in situ and laboratory observations, analysis and experimentation; f) Computer and computer software, including models and modelling techniques; g) Expertise, knowledge, skills, technical/scientific/legal know-how and analytical methods related to marine scientific research and observation. Indicator 14.a.1 shows the annual national research budget allocated by governments in the field of marine technology, relative to the overall national governmental research and development budget in general. Unit: percentage; raw data in national currency. The proportion can be calculated, and if needed, data can be converted by the international agency into USD.  \n",

to and implementation of ocean-related instruments that implement international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources. There are two aspects to this indicator: Last updated: February 2021 • the number of countries making progress in ratifying and acceding to ocean-related instruments that implement international law as reflected in UNCLOS for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources, and • the number of countries making progress in implementing such instruments through legal, policy and institutional frameworks.  \n",

concept for Goal 15 and target 15.1 as well as for target 15.2. It has been formally defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows: [a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and environmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations” (Resolution A/RES/62/98) The indicator is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of sustainable forest management. The environmental values of forests are covered by three sub-indicators Last updated: February 2021 focused on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources. Social and economic values of forests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-indicator provides further qualification to the management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are independently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards. The sub-indicators are: 1. Annual forest area change rate 2. Above-ground biomass stock in forest 3. Proportion of forest area located within legally established protect areas 4. Proportion of forest area under a long-term forest management plan 5. Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme A dashboard is used to assess progress related to the five sub-indicators. The adoption of the dashboard approach aims at ensuring consideration of all dimensions of sustainable forest management and provides for clear view of areas where progress has been achieved.  \n",

Land degradation is defined as the reduction or loss of the biological or economic productivity and\\ncomplexity of rain fed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest and woodlands resulting  from a combination of pressures, including land use and management practices. This definition was\\nadopted by and is used by the 196 countries that are Party to the UNCCD.1\\n(see also Figure 1)\\nLand Degradation Neutrality (LDN) is defined as a state whereby the amount and quality of land\\nresources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security remain\\nstable or increase within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems (decision 3/COP12).2\\nTotal land area is the total surface area of a country excluding the area covered by inland waters, like\\nmajor rivers and lakes.3\\nThe measurement unit for this indicator is the spatial extent (hectares or km2) expressed as the\\nproportion (percentage or %) of land that is degraded over total land area.\\nSDG indicator 15.3.1 is a binary - degraded/not degraded - quantification based on the analysis of\\navailable data for three sub-indicators to be validated and reported by national authorities. The subindicators (Trends in Land Cover, Land Productivity and Carbon Stocks) were adopted by the UNCCD’s\\ngoverning body in 2013 as part of its monitoring and evaluation approach.4\\nThe method of computation for this indicator follows the “One Out, All Out” statistical principle and is\\nbased on the baseline assessment and evaluation of change in the sub-indicators to determine the extent\\nof land that is degraded over total land area.\\nThe One Out, All Out (1OAO)5 principle is applied taking into account changes in the sub-indicators which\\nare depicted as (i) positive or improving, (ii) negative or declining, or (iii) stable or unchanging. If one of\\nthe sub-indicators is negative (or stable when degraded in the baseline or previous monitoring year) for a\\nparticular land unit, then it would be considered as degraded subject to validation by national authorities.  \n",

measure the extent and the changes of green vegetation in mountain areas - i.e. forest, shrubs, trees, pasture land, cropland, etc. – in order to monitor progress towards the mountain target. MGCI is defined as the percentage of green cover over the total surface of the mountain region of a given country and for given reporting year. The aim of the index is to monitor the evolution of the green cover and thus assess the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems.  \n",

 The indicator is defined as the number of countries that have adopted legislative, administrative and\\npolicy frameworks to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits. It refers to the efforts by countries to\\nimplement the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of\\nBenefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (2010) and the\\nInternational Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (2001).\\nThe Nagoya Protocol covers genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic\\nresources, as well as the benefits arising from their utilization by setting out core obligations for its\\ncontracting Parties to take measures in relation to access, benefit-sharing and compliance. The\\nobjectives of the International Treaty are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources\\nfor food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in\\nharmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity.\\nThe Protocol provides greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic\\nresources and associated traditional knowledge, and therefore, encourages the advancement of research\\non genetic resources which could lead to new discoveries for the benefit of all.\\nThe Nagoya Protocol also creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources, and\\nthereby enhances the contribution of biodiversity to development and human well-being. In addition,\\nParties to the Protocol are to encourage users and providers to direct benefits arising from the utilization\\nof genetic resources towards the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its\\ncomponents.\\nThe International Treaty has established the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing, which\\nfacilitates exchanges of plant genetic resources for purposes of agricultural research and breeding, by\\nproviding a transparent and reliable framework for the exchange of crop genetic resources. The\\nMultilateral System is instrumental to achieving the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic\\nresources as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use.   \n",

twin indicator consisting of: a) Official development assistance on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, defined as gross disbursements of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) from all donors for biodiversity. b) revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments, defined as revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments, covering biodiversity-relevant taxes, fees and charges, and positive subsidies. (New on-going work is underway to collect data on payments for ecosystem services and biodiversity offsets -- including the finance they mobilise for biodiversity).   \n",

twin indicator consisting of: a) Official development assistance on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, defined as gross disbursements of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) from all donors for biodiversity. b) revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments, defined as revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments, covering biodiversity-relevant taxes, fees and charges, and positive subsidies. (New on-going work is underway to collect data on payments for ecosystem services and biodiversity offsets -- including the finance they mobilise for biodiversity).   \n",

total count of conflict-related deaths divided by the total population, expressed per 100,000 population. ‘Conflict’ is defined as ‘armed conflict’ in reference to a terminology enshrined in International Humanitarian Law (IHL), and applied to situations based on the assessment of the United Nations (UN) and other internationally mandated entities. ‘Conflict-related deaths’ refers to direct and indirect deaths associated to armed conflict. ‘Population’ refers to total resident population in a given situation of armed conflict included in the indicator, in a given year. Population data are derived from annual estimates produced by the UN Population Division.   \n",

expressed per 100,000 populations. According to Article 3, paragraph (a) of the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol, trafficking in persons is defined as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs”. Article 3, (b) states “the consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) have been used”; Article 3, (c) states “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered trafficking in persons even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a);\"   \n",

when meeting with tax officials. In every Enterprise Survey (www.enterprisesurveys.org), there is a standard question which asks the survey respondent if they were inspected by or required to meet with tax officials. If the respondent indicates ‘yes’, then there is a follow-up question which asks if the respondent was expected to provide a gift or an informal payment during these inspections/meetings. The response options include “yes”, “no”, “don’t know”, and “refuse”. Enterprise Surveys are firm-level surveys conducted in World Bank client countries. The survey focuses on various aspects of the business environment as well as firm’s outcome measures such as annual sales, productivity, etc. The surveys are conducted via face-to-face interviews with the top manager or business owner. For each country, the survey is conducted approximately every 4-5 years.  \n",

government services (i.e. services to obtain government-issued identification documents and services for the civil registration of life events such as births, marriages and deaths)3. This is a survey-based indicator which emphasizes citizens’ experiences over general perceptions, with an eye on measuring the availability and quality of services as they were actually delivered to survey respondents. Respondents are asked to reflect on their last experience with each service, and to provide a rating on five ‘attributes’, or service-specific standards, of healthcare, education and government services (such as 3 The formulation ‘government services’ (also commonly called ‘administrative services’) is used in this metadata to mirror this more colloquial language used in the survey questionnaire. Last updated: 19 April 2021 access, affordability, quality of facilities, etc.). A final question asks respondents for their overall satisfaction level with each service. It is recommended that survey results, at a minimum, be disaggregated by sex, income and place of residence (urban/rural, administrative regions). To the extent possible, all efforts should be made to also disaggregate results by disability status and by ‘nationally relevant population groups’.  \n",

only on the first sub-component of indicator 16.7.1, namely on positions in national legislatures held by individuals of each target population (sex, age, persons with disabilities, and contextually relevant population groups). Last updated: March 2021 The legislative sub-component of indicator 16.7.1 aims to measure how representative of the general population are the individuals occupying key decision-making positions in national legislatures. More specifically, this indicator measures the proportional representation of various demographic groups (women, age groups) in the national population amongst individuals occupying the following positions in national legislatures: (1) Members, (2) Speakers and (3) Chairs of permanent committees in charge of the following portfolios: Foreign Affairs, Defence, Finance, Human Rights and Gender Equality. Furthermore, it looks at the electoral and constitutional provisions adopted by countries to secure representation in national legislatures of persons with disabilities and contextually relevant population groups.  \n",

which people think that politicians and/or political institutions will listen to, and act on, the opinions of\\nordinary citizens.\\nTo address both dimensions covered by this indicator, SDG indicator 16.7.2 uses two well-established\\nsurvey questions, namely: 1) one question measuring the extent to which people feel they have a say in\\nwhat the government does (focus on inclusive participation in decision-making) and 2) another question\\nmeasuring the extent to which people feel the political system allows them to have an influence on politics\\n(focus on responsive decision-making).\\nAll efforts should be made to disaggregate survey results on these two questions by sex, age group, income\\nlevel, education level, place of residence (administrative region e.g. province, state, district; urban/rural),\\ndisability status, and nationally relevant population groups.  \n",

                                         The indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international organizations has two components, the developing country proportion of voting rights and the developing country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions these two components are identical. The indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board.   \n",

       "219  This indicator is defined as the number of verified cases of killing, enforced disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, kidnapping and other harmful acts committed against journalists, trade unionists and human rights defenders on an annual basis. ‘Journalists’ refers to everyone who observes, describes, documents and analyses events, statements, policies, and any propositionsthat can affect society, with the purpose of systematizing such information and gathering of facts and analyses to inform sectors of society or soci ety as a whole, and others who share these journalistic functions, including all media workers and support staff, as well as community media workers and so-called “citizen journalists” when they 1 Current approved formulation of the indicator (E/2017/24-E/CN.3/2017/35). Informed by ongoing efforts to improve the methodology of the indicator, and consultations with relevant stakeholders, OHCHR, UNESCO and ILO have agreed to work towards a refinement of the current formulation to streamline and closelyalign it with target 16.10. The working draft of the proposed refinement is as follows: “Number of verified cases of killing, enforced disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, kidnapping and other harmful acts against journalists, trade unionists and human rights defenders” The elements of the proposed refinement serves as the basisfor this metadata and methodological approach. Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels Target 16.10: Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements Indicator 16.10.1: Number of verified cases of killing, kidnapping, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention and torture of journalists, associated media personnel, trade unionists and human rights advocates in the previous 12 months1 2 Last updated: 08 June 2018 momentarily play that role,2 professional full-time reporters and analysts, as well as bloggers and others who engage in forms of self-publication in print, on the internet or elsewhere.3 ‘Trade unionists’ refers to everyone exercising their right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of their interests.4 A trade union is an association of workers organized to protect and promote their common interests.5 ‘Human rights defenders’ refers to everyone exercising their right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at national and international levels,6 including some journalists and trade unionists. While the term ‘human rights advocate’ is broadly speaking a synonymous of ‘human rights defender,’ the latter is preferred as it is more consistent with internationally agreed human rights standards and established practice. The different categories of violations tracked by the indicator have been defined in accordance with international law and methodological standards and monitoring practices developed by the OHCHR and other international mechanisms and classified drawing on the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) disseminated by the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC). As such: • ‘Killing’ is defined as any extrajudicial execution or other unlawful killing by State actors or other actors acting with the State’s permission, support or acquiescence that were motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender; or while the victim was engaged in such activities; or by persons or groups not acting with the support or acquiescence of the State whose harmful acts were either motivated by the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, and/or met by a failure of due diligence on the part of the State in responding to these harmful acts, such a failu re motivated by the victim or associate engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender; and other unlawful attacks and destruction in violation of international humanitarian law leading to or intending to cause the victim’s death., corresponding to ICCS codes 0101, 0102 and 110139 and coded herein as A [0101, 0102 and 110139]. • `Enforced disappearance’ refers to the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty of a victim by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation 2 A/HRC/20/17, para 4 3 Human Rights Committee, General Comment 34, para 44 4UDHR, Art. 23, 4, supplemented by ICESCR, Article 8 5 ILO, Glossary on Labour Law and Industrial Relations (with special reference to the European Union)(Geneva, 2005) p 250 6 Article 1, Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, UNGA Res 53/144, A/RES/53/144 3 Last updated: 08 June 2018 of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the victim, which places the victim outside the protection of the law, corresponding to ICCS code 020222 (forced disappearance) and coded herein as B [02022ED] • ‘Torture’ refers to any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, for such purposes as obtaining from them or a third person information or a confession, punishing them, intimidating them or coercing them, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other persons acting in an official capacity, corresponding to ICCS code 11011 and coded herein as C [11011]. • ‘Arbitrary detention’ refers to any arrest or detention not in accordance with national laws, because it is not properly based on grounds established by law, or does not conform to the procedures established by law, or is otherwise deemed arbitrary in the sense of being inappropriate, unjust, unreasonable or unnecessary in the circumstances, and motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS code 020222 (unlawful deprivation of liberty) and coded herein as D [020222AD] • ‘Kidnapping’ refers to unlawfully detaining, taking away and/or confining a victim without their consent by persons or groups not acting with the support or acquiescence of the State, and the unlawful detention and/or confinement was met by a failure of due diligence on the part of the State in responding to the unlawful detention, such a failure motivated by the victim or associate engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS codes 020221 and coded herein as E [020221] • ‘Other harmful acts’ refers to other acts by State actors or other actors acting with the State’s permission, support or acquiescence causing harm or intending to cause harm and motivated by the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS codes 0301, 0219, 110133, 02012, 0205, 0208, 0210 and 0211, and coded herein as F [0301, 0219, 110133, 02012, 0205, 0208, 0210 and 0211]. ‘Verified cases’ refer to reported cases that contain a minimum set of relevant information on particular persons and circumstances, which have been reviewed by mandated bodies, mechanisms, and institutions, and provided them with reasonable grounds to believe those persons were victims of the above-mentioned human rights violations or abuses. Rationale: This indicator seeks to measure enjoyment of fundamental freedoms (e.g. freedom of opinion, freedom of expression and access to information, the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of association) on the premise that killing, enforced disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, kidnapping and other harmful act against journalists, trade unionists and human rights defenders have a chilling effect on the exercise of these fundamental freedoms. What distinguishes this 4 Last updated: 08 June 2018 indicator from Indicator 16.1.1 (number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population by sex and age) aside from the broader scope of violent incidents, is the motivation or causal factor, i.e. that the violation was motivated by the victim having stood up to defend the rights of others, exercise fundamental freedoms, or have occurred while the victim was engaged in such activities. Alongside indicator 16.10.2 (number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information) this indicator provides both a micro and macro-level snapshot of the state of the aforementioned fundamental freedoms in various contexts, as well as a link to the processes and structures required to meet human rights obligations with respect to those fundamental freedoms.  \n",

information. The purpose of this indicator is to report the total of number of countries that adopted legal guarantees on ATI, as well as the main tendencies in the implementation of these guarantees, which are presented in global aggregates. Based on the definition above, the indicator has two components: 1. Adoption Last updated: July 2021 2. Implementation Under each component, key questions were identified based on what can be called “Principles of Access to Information”, and which highlight essential components for effective implementation of Access to Information implementation at the country level. These Principles are synthesized from existing frameworks and documents recognised internationally.1 For the purpose of this survey, the principles of relevance are as follows: 1. Legal frameworks for Access to Information 2. Limited exemptions 3. Oversight mechanism 4. Appeals mechanism 5. Record keeping and reporting Each question values between 0 and 2. Upon the completion of the survey, a country can get a total score of 0-9. The total score of each country will not be assigned to any level category (e.g.: low, medium or high). However, it will contribute to global aggregates. More details on the computation method are under the section Methodology.  \n",

The major types of revenue are taxes (GFS code 11), social contributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code 13), and other revenue (GFS code 14). Of these, compulsory levies and transfers are the main sources of revenue for most general government units. In particular, taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable by government units from institutional units. Social contributions are actual or imputed revenue receivable by social insurance schemes to make provision for social insurance benefits payable. Grants are transfers receivable by government units from other resident or nonresident government units or international organizations, and that do not meet the definition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution. Other revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes, Last updated: March 2021 social contributions, and grants. Other revenue comprises: (i) property income; (ii) sales of goods and services; (iii) fines, penalties, and forfeits; (iv) transfers not elsewhere classified; and (v) premiums, fees, and claims related to nonlife insurance and standardized guarantee schemes.  \n",

expenditure funded by taxes. Budgetary central government, described in GFSM 2014 (paragraph 2.81) is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, particularly the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. The budgetary central government is often a single unit of the central government that encompasses the fundamental activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government’s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the ministries, departments, agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities, legislative bodies, and other entities that make up the budgetary central government are not separate institutional units. This is because they generally do not have the Last updated: March 2021 authority to own assets, incur liabilities, or engage in transactions in their own right (see GFSM 2014 paragraph 2.42). including references to standards and classifications, preferably relying on international agreed definitions. The indicator definition should be unambiguous and expressed in universally applicable terms. It must clearly express the unit of measurement (proportion, dollars, number of people, etc.).  \n",

                          To provide a standardized instrument to monitor the macroeconomic stability of countries, the World\\nBank has designed a Macroeconomic dashboard including important macroeconomic indicators covering\\nthe external, financial, fiscal, and real sectors. The indicator selection builds on existing macroeconomic\\nmonitoring frameworks developed and used by international and regional agencies, such as the IMF, the\\nWB, the ECB and the OECD.   \n",

United States dollars committed to public-private partnerships in infrastructure.” The indicator by the World Bank Group defines the term Public-Private Partnership (PPPs) as “any contractual arrangement between a public entity or authority and a private entity, for providing a public asset or service, in which the private party bears significant risk and management responsibility.” The term infrastructure refers to: • Energy: electricity generation, transmission, and distribution, and natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines • Information and communications technology (ICT): ICT backbone infrastructure • Transport: Airports, railways, ports, and roads. • Water: potable water treatment and distribution, and sewerage collection and treatment. Rationale: The infrastructure gaps is significant and it would require to increase private sector financing. The rationale behind the indicator is to measure the changes in the volume of public private partnerships in infrastructure and assess trends and identify constraints for private sector participation.  \n",
