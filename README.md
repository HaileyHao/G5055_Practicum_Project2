## Project Description

This project is developed by graduate students in the Social Sciences program of Columbia University in collaboration with the UN SDG Fund. The objectives of this project is to develop models that could define and quantitatively measure the networks among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and monitor how these networks progress over time. The importance of this project lies in the context that the different domains of SDGs are interconnected and cannot be effectively resolved without being considered as interdependent, and the fact that although this networks should be both theoretical and evidence-based, few research have been conducted to validate their empirial groundings.

Languages used include Python and R.

## Project Scope

The group will first look at the examples of two specific countries, Indonesia and Guatemala, and at the second phase of the project find the appropriate method of scaling for universal application.

The reasons of choosing the two countries:

The team is looking at data starting from 2012, and with the voluntary national reviews (VNRs) released in the year of 2017, 2019, 2021, the team looks at the models' progress over time every two years.
