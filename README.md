## Project Description

This project is developed by graduate students in the Social Sciences program of Columbia University in collaboration with the UN SDG Fund. The objectives of this project is to develop models that could define and quantitatively measure the networks among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and monitor how these networks progress over time. The importance of this project lies in the context that the different domains of SDGs are interconnected and cannot be effectively resolved without being considered as interdependent, and the fact that although this networks should be both theoretical and evidence-based, few research have been conducted to validate their empirial groundings.

Languages used include Python and R.
